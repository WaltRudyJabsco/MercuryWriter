# LOOK Command Grammar — 5.7.2

## Interactive LOOK grammar

Current renderer keys to audit across normal, filter, selected, and marked states:

- Typing: live filter; multiple words narrow matches.
- `J/K` or arrows: move selection.
- `Tab`: mark/unmark; `A`: mark all matches; `X`: clear marked set.
- `Enter/→`: open file or descend directory.
- `C`: Copy To; `M`: Move To; `R`: remove.
- `B`: file clipboard; `Y`: copy path; `E`: edit; `O`: open with.
- `L`: send selected path(s) to LO context.
- `G`: request shell go-to for selected directory; `←`: parent.
- `Esc`: clear/back/cancel according to state; `q`: quit where applicable.

## Audit rule

`lk` and every explicit LOOK view mode are interactive on a TTY regardless of whether the directory fits on one screen. Output size controls scrolling, not capability.

## Node-scoped media output

`lk media outputs` discovers reachable playback endpoints. `lk media on NODE play TARGET` and transport variants route to one node-specific MediaSession/output. Signal uses the same routing surface; changing output can hand the queue/current index to another node.

## File catalog

```text
lk scan [ROOT]
lk catalog
lk find QUERY
fcl-node file-catalog [--node NODE] [--json]
```

`scan` is metadata-only. A bare scan uses the home directory with conservative exclusions. `find` prefers the reachable Fabric union and falls back locally; cataloging never grants access or transfers bytes.

### Content-search behavior

`lk scan [ROOT]` incrementally indexes bounded deterministic text for supported documents. `lk find QUERY` combines metadata and FTS5 content results; remote nodes execute their own search and return bounded matches rather than transferring the index. Unsupported, oversized, image-only, or unextractable files remain metadata-searchable.

## Fabric authorization and transport grammar (6.1)

Fabric commands remain explicit CLI grammar rather than natural-language parsing:

```text
lk fabric pair-code [URL]
lk fabric pair NODE CODE
lk fabric pair ENDPOINT CODE
lk fabric trust
lk fabric untrust NODE_ID
lk fabric transport
lk fabric endpoints
lk fabric allow CODE [once|trust]
lk fabric endpoint-code URL [once|trust]
lk fabric revoke-endpoint ENDPOINT_ID
```

Node pairing codes are one-use and time-bounded. Browser endpoint codes identify a pending request and may be approved from any reachable trusted Fabric node; LOOK routes the approval to the node hosting that browser. Long-lived browser credentials are stored as HttpOnly cookies and can be revoked independently of node trust. `lk fabric transport` reports Tailcat/Tailscale selection; Tailcat is direct pinned TLS and does not yet provide NAT traversal or relay.
