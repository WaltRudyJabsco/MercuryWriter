# Future Crash + LOOK 7.7.3 — PREVIEW PLANE

This release proves native graphics only in Preview View. ASCII remains canonical and immediate. iTerm2 native image/PDF pixels are a progressive overlay prepared off-thread; they cannot mutate query, selection, marks, or pager navigation. Native completion wakes the blocking key read rather than introducing a timer or redraw loop. Unsupported terminals and failures remain on the existing ASCII preview.

The normal filtered-list side preview is intentionally unchanged in 7.7.3. Once the adapter survives real terminal use, the same adapter can be attached to that already-known rectangle without changing the pager model.
