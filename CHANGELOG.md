# 8.7.0 — FABRIC VISION

- Add user-initiated Fabric screen capture across trusted nodes through `/v1/vision/screen`.
- Add `lk vision screen [@NODE]`, direct Chafa preview, explicit `--save`, and zero-file `--ask` analysis.
- Add bounded foreground `--watch` observation; the node never schedules capture itself and unchanged frame hashes omit image bytes from transport.
- Capture files are temporary, server responses declare ephemeral/non-persistent semantics, remote relays use existing Fabric authentication, and frames are compressed/bounded before transfer.

# 8.6.1 — MEDIA PLAYER

- Add `lk mp`, a unified terminal media workspace combining Fabric library search, selection, metadata/remote artwork, queue access, now-playing state, and transport controls.
- Library and queue share LOOK navigation semantics; typing filters immediately, `Tab` marks, `Enter` plays, and `A` appends to the queue.
- `L` and `Q` switch Library/Queue views while Space, seek, previous/next, shuffle, repeat, and stop remain live everywhere.
- `lk player` and `lk media find` remain focused views over the same MediaSession/Fabric machinery; `lk mp` introduces no second media backend.

# 8.5.5 — MEDIA FINISH

- Media Find frame replacement clears the remainder of every terminal row, eliminating stale suffixes and duplicated footer/help artifacts without reintroducing blank-screen flashes.
- Remote artwork is latest-selection-wins and nonblocking; interactive views never fall through to synchronous cover-image transport.
- `ART… requesting <node>` / `ART unavailable` make remote preview state visible.
- Local and owner-rendered remote cover art use explicit full-RGB Chafa symbol output for matching color behavior.

- Media Find now composes each frame off-screen and swaps it in with one terminal write; arrow navigation no longer clears to a blank screen before redraw.
- Unified Node media helpers find `chafa` and `ffmpeg` in Homebrew/Linuxbrew/system paths even from sparse service environments.
- Remote preview identity falls back to the exact owner/id/path selected by the working playback route, so artwork cannot drift from audio routing.
- `lk player`: `s` toggles mpv playlist shuffle/unshuffle and preserves LOOK's runtime queue map; `r` remains repeat.

# 8.5.3 — TERMINAL PREVIEW

- Remote LOOK Player/Media Find artwork can now be rendered on the Fabric node that owns the media and returned as tiny Chafa terminal rows; endpoint disks are not filled with preview images.
- Player starts remote preview fetches in the background and shows `ART… loading remote preview` while the first frame settles.
- The 8.5.1/8.5.2 cover-byte endpoint remains as compatibility fallback.
- Player transport time is left-anchored; the progress bar now gives up width before elapsed/duration text.

# 8.5.2 — REMOTE COVER FIX

- Add `/v1/media/cover` to the Unified Node so remote endpoints can request only artwork for a catalog item.
- Extract/cache embedded or conventional sidecar cover art on the owning node; never fetch the whole song just to discover artwork.
- Cache received remote covers locally under `~/.cache/look/media-art/remote/`, keyed by Fabric identity and media mtime.
- Bound remote cover fetches to 2 MB / 2 seconds and use only a short in-memory negative cache for misses.
- Media Find and `lk player` continue to use the same proven Chafa renderer once the cover is local.

# 8.5.0 — LOCKDOWN

- `lk player` now uses the same Chafa terminal-art renderer as Media Find and preserves its ANSI/Unicode rows intact.
- Release documentation, help, man pages, component identities, and installer version checks were audited.
- Bundle and component versions are now explicit: bundle 8.5.0, LOOK 4.53.0, Future Crash 1.2.2.
- Package hygiene and release-consistency checks are part of the release gate.

# 8.4.3 — PLAYER ASCII

- `lk player` now renders cover art through a strict one-byte ASCII path instead of Chafa/ANSI/Unicode symbols.
- Player artwork grows to an 11-row right-hand panel; playback controls, EQ, metadata, and Media Find rendering are otherwise unchanged.
- Media Find keeps the restored 8.3.19 Chafa renderer.

# 8.4.2 — ART ROLLBACK

- Restores Media Find artwork rendering to the exact synchronous 8.3.19 contract; removes the 8.3.20 native-overlay path from Media Find.
- Restores `lk player` to the same proven `_media_cover_lines()` renderer used by 8.3.19.
- Leaves later navigation, rename/delete, Fabric catalog, preview, and startup-feedback work unchanged.

# 8.4.1 — MEDIA ART RESTORE

- Restores the proven 8.3.18 direct media-path artwork call as the primary path for Media Find and LOOK Player.
- Fabric/physical-source resolution remains fallback-only.
- Player uses the same art source, preferring rich terminal symbols and falling back to portable ASCII.

# 8.4.0 — MEDIA CANON

- Restore the proven local-first embedded album-art path before Fabric fallback.
- Remove permanent negative artwork-cache poisoning; successful covers remain cached.
- Player album art now has a deterministic ffmpeg ASCII renderer and no Chafa dependency.
- Media Find retains richer Chafa art when available and native progressive thumbnails.
- Visibility state now separates endpoint-local hides from future explicit Fabric-wide exclusions.
- Release packaging strips Python/test cache residue and enforces a lean bundle.
- Preserve 8.3.22 object tools, destination picker, footer semantics, previews, and startup feedback.

# 8.3.22 — CARET + ART

- Rename is now a real inline editor: Left/Right move the caret, Home/End jump, Backspace/Delete edit, Enter commits, and Esc alone cancels. Up/Down are inert in rename mode.
- Shift-R remains rename for files/folders and marked sets; #/##/### provide deterministic batch numbering. Shift-D remains explicit delete/remove.
- Media artwork now resolves an existing local physical source from logical/Fabric catalog rows before extracting embedded or sidecar art.
- Media Find therefore regains immediate ASCII album art plus progressive native thumbnails when supported; LOOK Player uses the same resolved source for portable ASCII art.
- No remote media file is fetched merely to paint artwork.
- Preserves 8.3.21 object-action footer, larger bounded preview, and startup feedback fixes.

# 8.3.20 — INSPECT POLISH

- Arrow-selection now switches the footer to the same object-action command set as explicit selection; preview state and available file operations can no longer diverge.
- Automatic LOOK side previews are enlarged to a middle-ground thumbnail while remaining hard-bounded above the footer; explicit `V` Preview remains the large view.
- Media Find keeps instant Chafa artwork and progressively replaces only that art rectangle with native iTerm/Kitty pixels when available; navigation never waits for artwork.
- `lk player` now uses a deliberately ASCII-only album-art renderer to avoid replacement glyphs and wide-symbol/font incompatibilities.

# 8.3.17 — DESTINATION

- Selecting an item in ordinary LOOK browse now immediately engages the side inspection/preview pane; there is no longer a selected-but-uninspectable state.
- Copy To / Move To keep the editable destination line as the canonical destination. Tab still completes paths; Down/Right opens an arrow-driven LOOK Destination picker; Enter returns the chosen directory to the line so a new child directory can be appended before execution.
- Destination picker preserves LOOK navigation: arrows move, Shift-Up/Down page, Shift-Left/Right jump to ends, Left ascends, Right descends, Enter commits, Esc cancels.
- Media Find `I` info now discovers local cover/folder/front artwork and renders a compact right-justified terminal cover beside metadata when Chafa is available, with metadata-only fallback.

# 8.3.16 — CATALOG CLOCK

- Fixes `lk media find` falling back to the local library even while the Unified Node and peers are healthy.
- The CLI previously allowed only 2.5 seconds for `/v1/media/fabric`, while that endpoint may legitimately spend up to 12 seconds on each remote catalog route. The client now gives an explicit Fabric catalog request 45 seconds without weakening ordinary local-node health checks.
- Media transport, playback, trust, and Tailcat routing are unchanged.

# 8.3.16 — FABRIC AWAKE

- The installer now wakes a stopped Tailscale backend before reconciling Future Crash Serve routes; on macOS it launches the Tailscale app and waits for the backend to become live.
- Fabric media aggregation refreshes peer discovery on an explicit catalog request and tries every authenticated peer route, so one stale preferred endpoint cannot collapse Media Find back to the local library.
- Paired Fabric names remain canonical across Tailscale hostname changes; transport labels such as `sasha-linux-pc` no longer rename a trusted `3090` node or split it into a duplicate peer.

# 8.3.16 — SERVE OWNER

- Future Crash now owns its Tailscale Serve configuration from one reconciler instead of letting Node API and Albert mutate persistent Serve state independently.
- The reconciler manages only Future Crash ports 7330 (Albert), 7331 (Signal), and 7332 (guarded Node API), preserving unrelated user Tailscale Serve mappings.
- Serve updates use `--yes`, so stale backends are replaced deterministically instead of failing behind a hidden interactive confirmation.
- If a managed port still conflicts, only that Future Crash port is turned off and rebuilt; global `tailscale serve reset` is never used.
- Installation now fails with the actual Serve status and exact privileged repair commands if Tailscale permissions prevent reconciliation.

# 8.3.16 — ROUTE FIX

- Fixes macOS Tailcat advertisements that could become `host.local.local`; mDNS names are normalized to exactly one `.local` suffix.
- Tailcat now finds Tailscale from launchd's sparse PATH, including Homebrew and the macOS app bundle, and records why Tailscale discovery failed instead of silently omitting overlay endpoints.
- Fabric Doctor reports the live Tailcat release and Tailscale DNS/IP discovery state so missing overlay routes are explicit.
- Installer now verifies the live :7443 Tailcat advertisement is the current release and rejects stale or malformed `.local.local` advertisements before reporting success.
- Media playback remains unchanged.

# 8.3.16 — ROUTE TRUTH

- Fabric Doctor now probes every trusted peer endpoint independently and reports exact success/failure, latency, and the currently selected route.
- Peer discovery gives the last successful authenticated route first refusal instead of repeatedly stalling on a dead `.local` or stale DHCP address.
- Route diagnostics are local-control only and reuse existing pinned Tailcat certificates and Fabric authorization; no trust boundary is weakened.
- Media playback and browser representation paths are unchanged.

# 8.3.16 — LOCKSTEP

- Fixes the upgrade split-brain revealed by 8.3.10: LOOK, installed release metadata, and the resident Unified Node are now verified as one release before install success.
- `lk --version` now reports both the LOOK version and installed Future Crash + LOOK release, so a stale install is visible immediately.
- The installer rejects a bundle whose embedded LOOK version disagrees with its installer declaration.
- After installation, the installer requires the installed LOOK command to report the exact release and requires the live node on :7332 to report 8.3.16.
- Keeps the 8.3.10 macOS launchd restart/listener diagnostics; media playback code is unchanged.

# 8.3.16 — LISTEN

- Mac installer now explicitly kickstarts Tailcat after launchd bootstrap.
- Fabric Doctor separates local :7443 listener health, advertised endpoints, trust, and peer catalog reachability.
- Media/video transport remains unchanged from the working 8.3.9 path.

# 8.3.9 — OPEN FABRIC

- Learns a trusted peer's live Tailscale DNS/IP addresses as short-lived Tailcat endpoints, retaining the certificate and auth token established at pairing. This lets Mac peers recover from stale LAN/.local advertisements without weakening Fabric identity.
- Broad `play a video` / `play a movie` choices now exclude obvious application/cache/developer trees and tiny video-shaped assets under 512 KiB. They remain searchable in the catalog; they simply do not compete with human videos for conversational random choices.
- Leaves the now-working Albert/Signal owner+item video byte path unchanged.


- Broad video choices now require a real video filename extension; stale MIME metadata can no longer surface source/system files as movies.
- Pending Albert/Signal media choices understand natural continuations such as “you choose”, “you pick”, “choose for me”, “anything”, and “whatever”.
- While a media choice is pending, an unrecognized reply is reprompted instead of leaking into unrelated general cognition.
- Retains the unified owner+item browser-media transport introduced in 8.3.7.

# 8.3.6 — GTD

- Fixed Albert video ticket generation: the video/audio kind was referenced before it was parsed.
- Increased authenticated peer advertisement tolerance for sleeping/waking Macs.
- Fabric media aggregation now reports trusted/discovered peers whose advertisement is unavailable instead of silently omitting them.
- Added transport-focused diagnostics/tests around browser video ticket routing and partial Fabric catalogs.

# 8.3.3 — FOLLOW / CHOICE

- Media Find Shift-D now opens an ancestor-directory chooser with affected-item counts; media-root hiding requires explicit confirmation and Shift-U remains reversible.
- Media Find supports LOOK modern navigation and caches its 100k-row logical view instead of rebuilding/statting paths on every arrow press.
- LOOK browse/filter/select now follows the focused row inside the real sticky-header viewport.
- Fabric browser video uses an on-demand cached H.264/AAC MP4 representation when the original container/codec is not browser-safe; originals remain authoritative and untouched.
- Albert and Signal request browser video representations while retaining ticketed Range delivery.
- Albert broad video requests offer three choices plus Surprise me and retain pending choice state for numeric replies.

# 8.3.1 — MEDIA MEMORY

- Media Find Shift-D now hides only the selected item’s immediate parent directory; Shift-U removes the applicable item/directory visibility rule. Info reports the rule hiding an item.
- Tic-Tac-Toe gains large red/blue terminal sprites; Backgammon adopts the red/blue game language; GTNW scales its existing renderer to larger terminals without changing simulation behavior.
- Albert now hydrates Fabric video items through the same ticketed Range-capable browser path as audio, including video queues. Signal’s existing browser video path is regression-tested.

# 8.2.1 — INSTRUMENT PANEL

- Visible removable-media scan state in Media Library and Dash.
- Full Media Find provenance panel for diagnosing duplicates.
- Larger Chess/Checkers CRT boards and repaired bare `lk games` WOPR doorway.
- Existing Dash extended with Media + tiny Signal heartbeat; responsive layouts preserved.
- 589 tests.

# 8.2.0 — VIEW

- Albert audio cards use an explicit high-contrast dark-player palette for titles, metadata, queue position, EQ, and transport controls.
- LOOK interactive browse keeps its existing two-line header pinned while the directory body scrolls.
- Shift-F cycles session-local sort order: NAME → MODIFIED → SIZE → KIND → ADDED → NAME.
- Live sorting preserves the highlighted filesystem object in browse/filter mode.
- Added KIND and ADDED renderer modes; ADDED uses birth time where available and ctime as a fallback.
- Media transport and Signal playback paths are unchanged.

# Changelog

## 8.0.0 — CONSOLIDATION

- Albert now consumes the complete Fabric media queue, auto-advances, and exposes previous/next/clear with queue position.
- A new Albert audio request replaces the prior Albert audio queue; endpoint queues remain local to their surface.
- `lk media find` now supports LOOK-style backslash exclusion and Shift-A select-all-visible; Queue/Play/Save operate on the selection.
- `lk media clear` is documented in built-in help.
- Added canonical current-system and media documentation.
- Distribution packaging excludes Python bytecode and pytest/build caches; source, tests, documentation, and release history remain.
- Media transport and known-good Signal/LOOK playback paths are unchanged.

## 7.7.18 — Albert Native Audio

- Albert Fabric audio stays on the native media-element playback path.
- Removed Web Audio `createMediaElementSource()` from the decorative EQ path; the lightweight activity visualizer remains.
- Signal, LOOK/mpv, Fabric media transport, MM/MN/MP, Classics, and Arts are unchanged.

## 7.7.17 — Albert Media Path

- Albert Ask responses now carry durable `node + id` media identity instead of a pre-minted stream URL.
- Albert browsers acquire the short-lived media ticket at playback time, matching Signal's working browser contract.
- Preserves Range proxying and the existing Fabric/native media stack unchanged.

## 7.7.16 — EDGE OWNERSHIP

- macOS upgrades now retire only a provably stale Future Crash Unified Node listener before restarting :7332.
- Albert catalog playback now uses Signal's working `/api/media/audio` browser boundary with ticketed Range proxying.
- Media core, LOOK/mpv, transport shortcuts, Classics/Arts, and Signal playback remain unchanged.

## 7.7.15 — BROWSER EDGE

- Retry ingress readiness before installer rollback on macOS.
- Add ticket-aware HEAD support to Albert's browser media proxy.
- Leave working LOOK/Fabric/Signal media paths unchanged.

# 7.7.8 — MEDIA IDENTITY

Surgical media identity and transport dispatch repair.

# 7.7.8 — CLEAN HANDOFF

- Make Linux MPRIS/playerctl optional and nonfatal; use distro package managers rather than Linuxbrew.
- Separate mpv IPC liveness from loaded-media ownership; stopped/dead LOOK queues no longer steal MM/MN/MP.
- Fix Linux JPEG ImageMagick 7 invocation and add direct HTTP evidence to `lk media doctor`.

# 7.7.8 — MEDIA SESSION

- Restore remote Fabric media byte/range streaming through the ingress guard.
- Fix Linux JPEG native previews.
- Route MM/MN/MP through one active media-session owner across LOOK and supported system players.

# 7.7.5 — TRUE FRAME

- Makes macOS Fabric ingress a verified launchd lifecycle: bootstrap, kickstart, then :7333 health.
- Adds ingress-specific launchd/systemd/log/port diagnostics instead of a generic readiness failure.
- Native iTerm/Kitty previews now contain and center inside the established art rectangle while preserving source aspect ratio.
- ASCII/Chafa remains the immediate fallback; native paint only replaces the art rectangle once ready.

# 7.7.4 — CLEAN START

- Hardens macOS Unified Node bootstrap/kickstart and platform-correct failure diagnostics.
- Repairs Linux Kitty preview provisioning when Kitty is already installed; PNG also has a no-converter native path.
- Kitty native placements no longer move the LOOK cursor.

# 7.7.3 — PREVIEW BRIDGE

- Extends the proven ASCII-first native graphics plane from full Preview View into the ordinary wide filtered-list side preview.
- Adds a Kitty graphics driver for Linux while retaining ASCII as the immediate and universal fallback.
- Fixes macOS Albert installation: a bootstrapped LaunchAgent is explicitly kickstarted before health polling, and launchd state is printed on failure.
- Linux terminal provisioning remains optional and non-fatal; Kitty plus local thumbnail helpers are offered through the distribution package manager.


- Keeps the 7.7.1 filter-minus grammar and 7.7.0 Preview View behavior.
- Preview View still paints its ordinary ASCII/Chafa frame immediately.
- On macOS iTerm2, image/PDF previews are prepared off-thread and progressively replace only the known Preview View art rectangle using iTerm2 inline images.
- The worker never writes to the terminal. Completion wakes the existing blocking input read; the pager thread paints the result without a redraw or state transition.
- Latest selection wins: queued stale work is discarded rather than accumulated.
- Raster previews are bounded and cached under `~/.cache/look/previews` by path, mtime, and target scale.
- `LOOK_NATIVE_PREVIEW=0` is a hard kill switch. Unsupported terminals remain exactly ASCII.

# 7.7.1 — FILTER MINUS

- Interactive filter terms prefixed with `\` exclude matching names.
- Positive terms retain the existing AND-substring behavior; multiple exclusions compose.
- Negative-only filters work. `\.` specially excludes dot-prefixed names without excluding ordinary extension-bearing files.
- Existing `lk match GLOB v|t|n [--all]` wildcard/ranking behavior is unchanged.

# 7.7.0 — PREVIEW VIEW

- `V` toggles Preview View while filtering.
- Preview View uses the same filtered candidates, current item, and marked set as List View.
- Space marks/unmarks the current item; existing LOOK actions continue to use marked files, otherwise current.
- Esc leaves Preview View first, preserving the filter; `V` toggles back to List View.
- Preserves 7.6.4 SIMPLE PREVIEW's synchronous ASCII/Chafa-symbol renderer.

# 7.6.4 — SIMPLE PREVIEW

- Restores LOOK renderer/pager lineage to 7.5.7.
- Removes native terminal graphics from LOOK previews.
- Uses synchronous Chafa symbol previews for images and PDF page 1.
- Simplifies preview settings to ASCII/Off; legacy Auto/Graphics migrate to ASCII.

# 7.5.5 — ATTENTION ROUTER

- Fixes `lk voice preview` and the Settings preview row so they audition the configured default voice rather than a personality override.
- Adds typed Fabric attention events and explicit endpoint-aware voice routing through `lk alert [@TARGET] MESSAGE`.
- Supports origin, named nodes/endpoints, and `@all`; reserves `@active`/`@follow-me` without guessing presence.
- Reuses canonical node speech and authorized browser endpoint receipts instead of creating a second delivery system.
- Records Albert map consistency and natural-media parity as dedicated follow-up targets rather than patching them ad hoc.

# 7.5.3 — LOOK FEEL

- Makes Nerd Font file/folder glyphs the default LOOK presentation; Classic remains selectable.
- Adds image preview modes: Auto, Graphics, ASCII, and Off. Auto prefers Kitty/iTerm2/Sixel through Chafa only when the terminal advertises support, with symbol fallback.
- Expands feedback sound to Off/Subtle/Expressive. Sounds follow semantic receipts, not navigation keystrokes.
- Adds shared Fabric voice presets (Albert, Warm, Crisp, Deep, Max, Philosopher, Pirate, WOPR), personality voice overrides, and a voice preview action in `lk settings`.
- Preserves the 7.5.2 browse invariant: paging scans without selecting; Up/Down establishes object selection; Enter filters when neutral and opens when selected.

# 7.5.2 — LOOK FLOW

A focused LOOK interaction release.

- Up/Down from the ordinary unfiltered browse surface now enters a one-object browse cursor instead of scrolling the rendered screen by one line.
- The cursor follows LOOK display order and preserves the static multi-column grid.
- Enter/Right opens the highlighted object; Left remains parent/back.
- Page Up/Page Down, Space/B, Shift-Up/Down, Shift-Left/Right, g, and G retain their established page/end semantics.
- Filter/select mode retains the one-candidate-per-row invariant.
- Optional Nerd Font file icons are available in `lk settings`; classic ◆/· markers remain the default.
- Release packages exclude Python bytecode caches.

# 7.5.2 — ALBERT SOURCES

Albert saved objects, source provenance, and place/map rendering.

# 7.5.0 — OBSERVATION PLANE

- Added `core/observation.py`, a read-only host observation plane separate from actions, memory, and capability authority.
- Linux observes current desktop windows through `wmctrl` when available and active focus through EWMH/xprop; macOS observes Terminal windows and front-window identity through AppleScript.
- Observations reconcile onto stable LOOK object identities by token, OS window id, or process id instead of duplicating receipt objects.
- Live State now enforces TTL freshness: facts that cannot be refreshed age out of present-tense queries rather than becoming accidental permanent memory.
- Observed focus can outrank stale action salience.
- Added first-class JEV state queries such as `what windows are open`, answered before general cognition.
- Added relational command/reference semantics: `another` reuses the salient prior runnable object; `first/oldest/last/newest` select deterministically within a matching live object set.
- `lk state` now performs an observation refresh before displaying the current scene.
- Fabric advertises the observation capability separately from `state.live`.
- Installer ships and verifies the observation plane in installed layout.

# 7.3.0 — LIVE STATE

- Added `core/live_state.py`: a bounded present-tense state pool distinct from durable world history and memory.
- Host receipts create/update typed live objects; successful close actions retire them instead of leaving stale historical referents active.
- Linux terminal objects are cheaply reconciled against their process handles; dead processes retire automatically.
- Live objects carry provenance, observation age, confidence, TTL, and stable identity.
- JEV now resolves current/salient objects and relational language such as `the other one` against the live scene; ambiguous named matches still fall through.
- Cognition receives only a deterministic relevant slice of LIVE STATE, not the full machine scene on every turn.
- Added `lk state [show|refresh]` as observability for spinning plates; normal operation updates state automatically.
- Fabric advertises `state.live` alongside curated capabilities.
- Installer ships and byte-verifies the live-state core and smoke-tests it in installed layout.

# 7.2.0 — CAPABILITY CURATOR

- Added automatic, non-destructive node capability curation with persisted adapter evidence.
- Added typed terminal-window actions: maximize, fullscreen, focus, minimize, and close.
- Added Linux stable window tokens and a zero-dependency terminal control channel; stronger OS adapters win when discovered.
- Added macOS Terminal window action adapters through authoritative window IDs.
- Fabric now advertises curated window capabilities instead of assuming them.
- Successful real actions promote discovered adapters to proven; fallback dispatches remain explicitly unverified.
- Added `lk capabilities [show|refresh]` as an observability surface, not a setup requirement.

# 7.1.0 — JEV FABRIC

- Promote JEV-0 deterministic judgment trees to a universal node runtime layer.
- Adopt the existing OpenJev 2B worker as JEV-1: local learned judgment between deterministic trees and general cognition.
- `--openjev=auto` now provisions JEV-1 on capable nodes (12 GiB+ RAM) and fails gracefully when prerequisites/model acquisition are unavailable.
- Add Linux/macOS JEV-1 lifecycle wiring and a device-neutral launcher that selects CUDA, Apple MPS, then CPU.
- Add top-down image intent ownership: explicit image-generation prompts bypass weather hijacking even when their payload contains rain/snow/weather words.
- Normalize discourse/self-address before JEV (`and`, `then`, `now`, `lo`, `look`).
- Add bounded typed-referent name/prefix resolution (`close ascii` → unique active `asciiquarium` terminal), with ambiguity falling through.
- Add end-to-end regressions for the observed image/weather and referent failures.

# 7.0.5 — TYPED REFERENTS

- Host actions can now produce typed referent objects carried in authoritative receipts.
- New-terminal launches produce a `terminal_window` referent with a host-close handle.
- JEV resolves narrow deictic follow-ups such as `close that window` before cognition.
- Linux records the inside-terminal process PID; macOS records Terminal's window ID.
- `close_object` is a typed host primitive, eliminating the prior `run_command` → file-dispatch failure.
- Ambiguous compatible referents fall back to cognition instead of guessing.
- Adds end-to-end regressions for the exact launch/close continuity failure.

# 7.0.4 — JEV WIRED

- Ship `core/jev.py` in the unified installer.
- Verify installed JEV bytes against the release.
- Import/smoke-test JEV in installer runtime validation.
- Add an installed-layout regression with no source-tree fallback.

# 7.0.3 — JEV TREES

- Add shared `core/jev.py` as the first small deterministic judgment-tree layer: explicit structure is resolved before model cognition, while ambiguous language falls through.
- Parse command imperatives into typed semantics rather than literal argv. `run asciiquarium again` now executes `asciiquarium`; `again` never reaches the program.
- Recognize `in the terminal`, `interactively`, and `in a new/another/separate terminal` as execution modifiers rather than command text.
- Add asynchronous new-terminal dispatch: macOS Terminal via AppleScript; Linux via a bounded known terminal-launcher set. LOOK returns immediately after successful dispatch.
- Preserve prior terminal presentation for an explicit `again` only when the command referent matches; current authority is always rechecked.
- Add end-to-end regressions proving JEV executes before cognition for the two observed failures, plus modifier-order, multi-argument executable, ambiguity, dispatch-success, and dispatch-failure tests.

# 7.0.2 — ACTION REFLEX

- Route unambiguous `run`, `launch`, `execute`, and `start` imperatives directly to the host action edge before cognition/model deliberation.
- Restore the most recent typed `run_command` receipt as a bounded four-hour retry referent, so a fresh LO process can honor `try again` without reconstructing action state from prose.
- Treat an exact bare repeat of the last command name as a deterministic retry.
- Recheck the current access profile and POWER hazard classifier on every retry; referents persist, authority never does.
- Preserve interactive exit 130 as `launched; interrupted`, and surface that exact receipt on direct/repeated execution.
- Add a real LO-turn regression that fails if cognition is invoked before `run asciiquarium in the terminal`, plus stale-memory, missing-executable, bare-repeat, and authority-downgrade coverage.

# 7.0.1 — AUTHORITY THAT ACTS

- Recalibrates CONSERVATIVE / WORKSPACE / POWER / UNSAFE into four distinct authority grants.
- POWER auto-runs ordinary current-user commands; deterministic host policy keeps hazardous commands behind native confirmation.
- Interactive exit 130 is recorded as a launched/interrupted session, not a launch failure.
- Explicit command retries execute again; prior failure never vetoes a fresh operator imperative.
- Persistent access-level changes are adopted by an already-running LO session on the next turn.
- Command attempts and exact receipts remain available for deterministic retry and truthful follow-up explanation.

## 7.0.0 — WORLD STATE

- Add persistent typed `world_state.json`: goals, task steps, receipts, failure classes, and wake events survive model/session boundaries.
- Wire every common tool transaction through structural preflight and typed completion receipts; consequential effects are marked deliberate/verify-required while reads stay normal.
- Persist cognition task graphs instead of letting them evaporate after a turn.
- Inject recent authoritative world receipts into cognition so machine truth outranks conversational reconstruction.
- Answer “what was the tool error/failure?” deterministically from the exact typed failure receipt.
- Make prior failures evidence rather than vetoes: a new explicit operator request is a fresh attempt.
- Restore the missing `_looks_like_shell_file_discovery` guard that caused `run_command` to crash with NameError; freeze `asciiquarium` as a regression case.
- Add explicit interactive TTY execution for requests such as “run asciiquarium in the terminal”; captured shell work remains non-interactive.
- Add `lk world` observability for active goal, recent typed receipts/failures, and bounded events.
- Preserve 6.9.4 LOOK navigation and view-relative move fixes.

## 6.9.4 — VIEW-RELATIVE MOVE DESTINATIONS

- Fix interactive `C Copy To` / `M Move To` resolving relative destination names against the shell process working directory instead of the directory LOOK is currently displaying.
- A typed relative destination such as `archive` now means `<current LOOK directory>/archive` on both macOS and Linux. Absolute paths and `~` expansion remain unchanged.
- This removes the launch-directory-dependent failure where multi-file moves could work on one machine but try to create/use the destination under `$HOME` on another.

## 6.9.3 — FAST NAVIGATION

- Shift-Up / Shift-Down mirror Page Up / Page Down across LOOK browse, filter, and selection states.
- Shift-Left / Shift-Right jump to the beginning / end of the active list.
- Lowercase `g` in the ordinary LOOK viewer toggles between the two ends; uppercase `G` remains Go.
- Uses the same standard CSI modifier sequences verified on macOS and Linux terminals.

## 6.9.3 — RENDEZVOUS VERSION CONSISTENCY

- Fix rendezvous runtime and HTTP server banner still reporting 6.9.0 inside the 6.9.1 bundle.
- Add regression coverage requiring all runtime release surfaces to match root VERSION.

# 6.9.3 · LOOK FIT & FINISH

- Interactive LOOK/filter/select views now enforce one candidate per terminal row; static noninteractive listings may still use compact columns.
- Remove selectable-view section/header rows so visual row, selection index, and preview target remain one-to-one even with hundreds of results.
- Add a persistent interactive clipboard shelf: `B` stages Copy, `T` stages Cut, and `P` pastes into the current LOOK directory.
- Clipboard paste delegates to the existing `_batch` copy/move transaction engine, preserving rollback and `lk undo`; successful Cut clears its shelf only after the move completes.
- Existing `C Copy To`, `M Move To`, `R remove`, marking, native OS clipboard, and static column layouts remain intact.

# 6.9.0 · COGNITIVE FABRIC

- Fold the planned 6.8.2 receipts/sets work and 6.9 cognition work into one release.
- Speech is now receipt-enforced: printed `audiospeak(...)` prose is repaired into one real `audio_speak` attempt or reported as unexecuted.
- Explicit anaphoric location memory (`remember that I live there`, `default to there`) resolves only against an already-authoritative home atom and writes a synchronous memory receipt.
- Model prose may not claim durable remembering without a host memory-write receipt.
- Add named Ollama model sets with save/show/apply/list/delete plus CHAMPION and CHALLENGER labels and set comparison.
- Extend model tests with LOOK-specific Fabric Fit probes derived from real failures: receipt discipline, stale-edge isolation, memory truth, and speech primitive selection.
- Curator BALANCED/DEEP ranking now considers Fabric Fit alongside runtime, tools, agent behavior, and reasoning.
- Add explicit evidence authority classes and receipt objects to shared cognition; action/tool successes feed the receipt journal as provenance.
- Persistent goal state now records wake and close conditions instead of only an opaque status.
- Tailcat transport architecture is unchanged; Tailscale remains the fallback while NAT traversal/relay is deferred.

# 6.8.1 · MODEL GROUND TRUTH

- Wire the existing Fabric route explainer through the `lk fabric route reflex|balanced|deep` CLI wrapper.
- Add regression coverage so documented Fabric verbs cannot be omitted from the LOOK dispatcher.

# 6.8.0 · MODEL GROUND TRUTH

- Future Crash defaults to the Fabric curator BALANCED role; Signal defaults to REFLEX.
- Add explainable Fabric routing and benchmark freshness semantics.
- Dash exposes curator mode/profile/target from the same evidence used by residency policy.

# 6.7.6 · CANONICAL EDGE

- Canonical JSON information edges use bounded dual transport: Python urllib first, native curl fallback second.
- WEATHER transport failures now surface the actual DNS/TLS/socket/provider error and emit a typed tool_error event.
- Keeps WEATHER epistemic strictness: fallback transport may obtain the receipt, but model memory still cannot substitute for live conditions.
- Added regression coverage for transport fallback and diagnostic preservation.

# 6.7.4 · CLEAN BREAK

- Live receipt requirements are capability-specific and turn-local; failed WEATHER state cannot induce invented `LIVE HISTORY` requirements.
- Home clarification candidates are persisted only after canonical location/weather validation.
- Simple time/date questions answer directly from the trusted host clock.
- Added regressions for evidence isolation and transactional home teaching.

# 6.7.3 · LET GO

- Pending cognitive slots now get first refusal rather than ownership of the next utterance.
- Filling `weather.location` clears the human-input obligation before external I/O.
- Failed WEATHER runs retire as failed instead of persisting as zombie goals.
- Explicit weather restatements extract only their location while unrelated questions/commands supersede pending clarification.
- Added regression coverage for `what is the time` / `lo what is the date` after a failed weather continuation.

# 6.7.2 · STAY AWAKE

- Added persistent `brain_state.json` working state with active goals and unresolved slots.
- Added `lk brain` / `lk brain clear`.
- Weather→home clarification now persists `home.location`, teaches it from the answer, resumes the original goal, and closes on a real receipt.
- `I live in …` and `remember that I live in …` synchronously update typed home memory.
- Learned home is the default for otherwise locationless weather.
- Expanded cheap recent-memory retention and bounded semantic retrieval.
- Kept cognition event-driven: no always-spinning model loop.

# 6.7.1 · HOME BASE

- Weather location questions now create deterministic working state; the next bare place answers that exact pending question.
- `home` is an operator-owned semantic alias, never a geocoder guess. Explicit `home is …` corrections replace the previous home location and sync as a typed Fabric memory atom.
- `my weather` / `home` reuse the learned location.
- Successful current-weather receipts render a deterministic final answer instead of depending on model prose.
- 6.7 BEACON rendezvous behavior is otherwise unchanged.

# 6.7.0 · BEACON

- Added signed, capability-slot Fabric rendezvous for already-paired nodes.
- Pairwise authorization tokens never cross the network; only one-way rendezvous slots do.
- Added short-lived discovered Tailcat endpoints without changing pinned peer identity/certificates.
- Added `lk fabric rendezvous` and self-hostable `fcl-rendezvous`.
- Tailscale remains an explicit fallback; hole punching and relay are intentionally deferred.

# 6.6.5 · PICTURE LOCK

- Fixes native video startup on current mpv releases by removing the invalid `--video=yes` option.
- Keeps `--force-window=immediate` for video so slow or remote media still gets a visible player immediately.
- Lets mpv's default `video=auto` behavior choose the appropriate video track instead of overriding it.
- Applies the same launch rule to local queue playback and Fabric stream playback.
- Preserves 6.6.4 SHOWTIME startup-readiness receipts and all 6.6.x cognition, memory, selector, and terminal fixes.

# 6.6.4 · SHOWTIME

- Makes native media receipts truthful: a new mpv worker must survive startup and expose LOOK's IPC socket before `MEDIA PLAY OK` can be returned.
- Uses `--force-window=immediate` for video so the player window appears before slow, remote, or failing media initialization can hide it.
- Surfaces early mpv exit/readiness failures with the owned player log instead of saving a fictional `playing` session.
- Includes 6.6.3 MOVIE NIGHT selector normalization and 6.6.2 TRUE CURSOR terminal editing.

# 6.6.3 · MOVIE NIGHT

- Restores conversational generic media selectors at the English edge: `play us a movie`, `play a movie for us`, `any movie will do`, `a movie is fine`, and equivalent audio forms now become typed random selectors instead of catalog text searches.
- Keeps actual movie/video playback on the existing media engine; this is a selector-routing fix, not a player rewrite.
- Includes the 6.6.2 TRUE CURSOR terminal Backspace/Delete fix.

# 6.6.2 · TRUE CURSOR

- Fixes LO terminal Backspace/Delete redraw corruption caused by ANSI-colored bytes inside the readline/libedit prompt width.
- Separates the multi-line `YOU` label from line-editor ownership.
- GNU readline marks ANSI escapes as zero-width; macOS libedit receives a plain-width-safe arrow prompt for deterministic redraws.
- Preserves normal history, arrows, Home/End, and existing LO cognition/memory behavior.

# 6.6.1 · LIVING MIND

- Makes successful host-action receipts authoritative through final presentation, including media/speech/game actions.
- Adds explicit working-state continuation for unresolved media selectors; a clarification refines the existing goal instead of starting over.
- Treats praise/acknowledgement as zero-tool social turns so LO cannot hallucinate a postmortem of an already completed action.
- Upgrades Living Memory to schema 4 with larger cheap candidate/durable budgets, machine-native atoms, tighter retrieval budgets, and 45-minute continuous domain recompilation.
- Successful goals/actions and resolver corrections become compact typed atoms; human-readable memory is rendered only at the inspection/prompt boundary.
- Fabric Memory v2 replicates machine atoms across trusted nodes alongside prose memory; background memory maintenance performs bounded peer convergence.
- Adds `lk memory learned` to inspect the human projection of machine-native learning.

# 6.6.0 · ONE BRAIN

- Adds `core/cognition.py`, a shared DecisionPlane used by LOOK, Signal, Albert, and machine clients.
- Adds a canonical Fabric Action Registry with dotted action IDs, risk/effect metadata, and `/v1/actions`.
- Adds fuzzy low-cost intent routing with typo tolerance; OpenJev is used only to break genuinely ambiguous bounded routes.
- Narrows model tool schemas before inference so strong web/media/files/speech/games/system intents cannot wander into unrelated tool families.
- Adds explicit Goal and dependency Plan objects plus turn-level satisfaction verification based on real tool receipts.
- Exposes `/v1/cognition/route`, `lo_engine.analyze_request()`, `action_registry()`, and `resolve_name()` for all surfaces.
- Installer now installs and verifies the cognition core as part of the unified release contract.

# 6.5.0 · LAST MILE

- Browser endpoints now have a reusable effect runtime with explicit queued/delivered/received/waiting/started/ended/error receipts.
- iPad/iPhone Safari audio is unlocked by a real user gesture; speech waits locally instead of being silently dropped when WebKit blocks autoplay.
- Albert and Signal share the same browser-effect receipt and audio-unlock behavior.
- `lk fabric speak @browser ...` now reports browser delivery as queued rather than implying that queued work has already played.
- Browser effect metadata advertises whether local audio has been unlocked, preparing the same runtime for media, beacon sound, and other endpoint-local effects.

# 6.4.12 · GROUND TRUTH

- Carries forward LIVE WIRE's daemon-owned browser endpoint dispatch so `lk fabric speak @ipad ...` resolves against the resident Fabric endpoint registry.
- Installer now prints the absolute bundle source directory and release before mutation.
- Installer refuses mixed bundles by cross-checking root, LOOK, Albert, Future Crash, node, ingress, and Tailcat version metadata.
- Cleans the remaining stale LOOK Fabric User-Agent version literal.
- Post-install verification still requires both installed CLI and live node daemon to report the exact bundle release.

# 6.4.11 · LIVE WIRE

- Fixed browser-effect routing from `fcl-node speak` / `lk fabric speak`: the CLI no longer consults its own empty in-memory browser-presence table.
- Added local-control `/v1/endpoints/fabric/dispatch`, so all active-browser resolution and action queuing happens inside the resident Fabric daemon that owns live endpoint state.
- Exact endpoint IDs and friendly labels such as `@ipad` now resolve against the same aggregated endpoint registry shown by `lk fabric endpoints`.
- The daemon-owned dispatch path is generic for future browser-local effects beyond speech.

# 6.4.10 · FRONT DOOR

- Restores Albert startup on installed Linux and macOS layouts by resolving the shared Fabric core from `~/.local/share/future-crash-look/core`, with source-tree fallback for development.
- Makes Albert installation health a hard contract: unified install now waits for `127.0.0.1:7330/health` and fails visibly instead of silently accepting a dead surface.
- Keeps 6.4.9 browser endpoint authorization/presence architecture intact once Albert is actually alive.

## 6.4.9 — BROWSER VOICE

- Browser sessions are first-class Fabric effect endpoints with live presence and capability advertisement.
- Authorized Albert and Signal browsers can receive `audio.speak` actions and synthesize speech locally.
- `lk fabric speak @ipad ...` can resolve an active browser endpoint when no full node matches.
- Albert now uses the shared accountless Fabric endpoint authorization gate before cognition/effect actions.

## 6.4.8 — SOUND CHECK

- Fixed Fabric speech under Linux systemd by teaching canonical service binary discovery about Linuxbrew (`/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin` and `~/.linuxbrew/bin`). Interactive WOPR voice and `/v1/audio/speak` now resolve the same eSpeak NG/SoX binaries.

## 6.4.7 — VOICEPRINT

- Promoted speech to a first-class Fabric local-effect capability: nodes now advertise `audio.speak` and accept `/v1/audio/speak` with explicit output-node routing through the existing Fabric transport.
- Added `fcl-node speak` / `lk fabric speak` and exposed `audio_speak` to the shared LO tool plane for explicit read-aloud, hands-busy notifications, and targeted room/node speech.
- Unified the WOPR voice on macOS and Linux around eSpeak NG + SoX; macOS `say` remains only a graceful fallback.
- LOOK Games now use Fabric speech first and the identical local speech pipeline as an offline fallback, fixing the Linux trigger path.
- WOPR login now speaks “GREETINGS PROFESSOR FALKEN. SHALL WE PLAY A GAME?” and board-game endings get sparse machine commentary. GTNW keeps its own dramatic semantics.
- eSpeak NG is now installed by default on macOS as well as Linux.

## 6.4.6 — FALKEN

- LOOK Games board polish: checkerboard-backed chess/checkers with edge coordinates and a real backgammon board with round checkers, bar, points, dice, and borne-off counts.
- `q`/Esc returns board games to the WOPR simulation menu; `s` remains a true stop. GTNW keeps its own exit semantics.
- The WOPR `LOGON: JOSHUA` ritual now appears on every game entrance, including bare `lk games`, which still deadpans `NO GAMES INSTALLED.` afterward.
- Lightweight WOPR voice: macOS uses the built-in Zarvox `say` voice; Linux uses `espeak-ng` with SoX processing when available. Set `LOOK_GAMES_VOICE=0` to mute it.
- Workstation dependencies now include SoX everywhere and `espeak-ng` on Linux.

# 6.4.5 · JOSHUA

- Unified obvious intent routing in the shared LO core so LOOK, Signal, and Albert use the same pre-inference gate.
- Current headlines/news requests now trigger deterministic web preflight from the shared core on every surface.
- LOOK Games requests are host-routed before inference; `gtnw` can no longer wander into filesystem search.
- Restored the original `lk games` deadpan response: `No games installed.`
- Named game commands enter the WOPR selector with the requested game preselected, then choose 0p/1p/2p in-terminal. Explicit mode arguments remain shortcuts.
- Added a one-time theatrical WOPR `LOGON:` gate; `JOSHUA` provisions the recreation channel locally.
- Albert now relies on the shared router rather than carrying its own headlines/search policy.

# 6.4.4 · Shall We Play

- Added LOOK Games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, Chess, Backgammon, and GTNW under one WOPR recreation channel.
- Added shared 0p/1p/2p mode grammar and common stop/restart/help controls.
- Preserved `lk ttt` and `lk gtnw` aliases.
- Games are lightweight and dependency-free; GTNW remains a 0-player simulation.

# 6.4.3 · Searchlight

- Repair Albert → LO → live-search failure handling and add direct SearXNG fallback.
- Preserve truthful stage-specific failures instead of generic cognition-offline paper.

## 6.4.2 — Clean Paper

- Current-information cognition now searches through Fabric SearXNG first; hosted Ollama search is fallback-only.
- Albert rejects raw model/tool protocol instead of printing function-call syntax onto the paper.
- Answer folds begin as real user/Albert threads and subsequent replies continue inside the same fold.
- Routine cognition plumbing is hidden from normal fold headers.
- `qrencode` joins the normal Homebrew/Linuxbrew workstation utility set, so Albert/Fabric QR handoff works after a standard install.

## 6.4.2 — Clean Paper

- Albert joins Fabric beacon/disco light shows through the local node light state.
- Answer folds now support continuing conversation in place instead of forcing every follow-up into a new card.
- Paste and drag/drop register images/files at Albert’s artifact edge and pass stable file references into the shared LO cognition engine.
- Current-news/headline requests explicitly require live search/tool evidence rather than model-memory answers.

## 6.4.0 — Open Door

- Albert is now reachable from trusted tailnet browsers through Tailscale Serve while remaining loopback-only itself.
- Added `lk albert url`, `lk albert qr`, and `lk albert ipad`/`remote` handoff commands.
- Unified Node advertises Albert local/tailnet URLs.
- Installer prints the iPad/tailnet URL when available.

## 6.3.8 — Browser Seat

- `lk media arts`, `lk media showcase`, and `lk media classic-arts` once again open the official Classic Arts Showcase page in the system default browser.
- Removed the special native HLS/mpv experiment for this Easter egg; All Classical audio remains native.
- Albert keeps its scaled/expandable Classic Arts in-fold presentation.

## 6.3.7 — Window Seat

- Fixed native video presentation when a LOOK-owned mpv already exists as an audio/headless session.
- Audio → video is now treated as a presentation-class transition: LOOK relaunches its owned mpv with explicit `--video=yes --force-window=yes` rather than reusing a hidden audio worker.
- Audio → audio and video → video continue to reuse the existing mpv IPC session.
- Regression coverage includes the `classics` → `arts` sequence that exposed the bug on macOS.

## 6.3.6 — Clean Feed
- Classic Arts Showcase now prefers a direct HLS feed for native playback instead of opening the whole website. Albert uses the direct stream when the browser supports HLS and falls back to a fitted official-page embed.
- Albert video folds now contain the entire frame, add an expand/contract view, and scale website fallbacks into the fold instead of cropping their top-left corner.

## 6.3.5 — Dead Means Dead

- Albert explicitly tears down audio/video/EQ contexts before folds are dismissed or DOM is rebuilt. Saved items remain inert snapshots until reopened on paper.

## 6.3.4 — Saved Means Saved

- Albert Saved entries are durable snapshots that can be reopened onto the live paper after the original fold is dismissed.
- Saved entries now expose `open on paper` and `remove saved` instead of dead live-fold controls.
- Reopened audio folds recreate their player and visualizer normally.

## 6.3.3 — Alive

- Albert now loads the shared native LO engine directly instead of calling Signal's paired-browser `/api/chat` endpoint. Signal can be closed; Albert cognition remains available as long as LOOK/LO is installed.
- Albert keeps its own bounded session history so follow-ups retain context through the shared cognition plane.
- Albert audio folds gain a small live EQ: a real Web Audio analyser for safe local/same-origin audio, with a playback-synchronized fallback for cross-origin streams. Video folds deliberately remain clean.
- `lk player` gains a small audio-only playback visualizer. It never appears for video and is explicitly presentation, not fabricated frequency telemetry.

## 6.3.2 — One Brain

- Albert uses the shared LO cognition/tool plane for general requests.
- Persistent Albert session context enables coherent follow-ups.
- Removed the generic fake-understood terminal state.
- Albert fails closed when shared cognition is unavailable.

## 6.3.1 — Full Alphabet

- Fix interactive LOOK/media filters stealing lowercase `j/k` before text input.
- Use arrows or uppercase `J/K` for navigation while filtering; ordinary lowercase letters remain searchable.
- Preserve lowercase `j/k` navigation in shared selectors only when not actively typing a filter.
- Keep `q` as the empty-selector quit key without preventing `q` inside an active query.

## 6.3.0 — Meet Albert

- Albert 5 becomes a first-class installed Fabric surface at `http://127.0.0.1:7330`.
- Responsive Paper interface renders semantic result folds instead of app-shaped screens.
- Type, speech (where Web Speech exists), drag/drop, pin, save and dismiss are first-class inputs/actions.
- Albert exposes a small action registry and probes the Unified Node rather than pretending unavailable adapters exist.
- Browser media effects remain local by default; media preparation stays separate from playback ownership.
- `lk albert` opens the surface.
- `lk media classics` / `lk media classical` play All Classical Radio; `lk media arts` opens Classic Arts Showcase.

## 6.2.5 — Own the Output

- Keep browser-origin media effects pinned to the selected endpoint; no silent native-node fallback.
- Make native media ownership observable: Signal reports target and actual player.
- Launch LOOK-owned mpv with isolated config so per-machine user settings cannot silently disable video.
- Force a native video window for video queues and record launch argv/presentation in session state.
- Surface lightweight media-search progress before potentially slow Fabric resolution.

# 6.2.4 — Good Listener

- Establish one media-language contract across direct `lk play`, terminal LO, Signal, and Fabric routing: selector, fuzzy, literal, or clarify.
- Fix `lk play a song` being treated as catalog text; generic noun phrases now become structured selectors before lookup.
- Make ordinary named media fuzzy by default while preserving deterministic literal lookup through quoted conversational targets and CLI `--exact`/`--literal`.
- Normalize filename surfaces for matching: case, extension, underscore, dash, slash-like punctuation, and spacing no longer need exact typing.
- Add confidence/margin gating so strong fuzzy matches execute, close matches offer candidates, and weak matches fail cheaply instead of creating accidental queues.
- Preserve exact artist/album/title group semantics and existing explicit structured selectors.
- Carry literal match mode through Signal → Unified Node → LOOK.
- Signal Window 1.10.4.
- 271 tests pass.

# 6.2.3 — Know Your Limits

- Terminal LO and Signal now consume the same `resolved / clarify / no_match` intent contract; selector phrases no longer depend on surface-specific parsing.
- Prompt decoration such as LOOK's visible `›` glyph is stripped at the natural-language edge, so pasted transcripts normalize identically to typed commands.
- Media queue entries gain conservative playability hints lazily, including for pre-6.2.3 catalogs; no full media rescan is required.
- `.m4p` is marked explicitly protected/restricted. Ordinary `.m4v`/`.mp4` files remain browser candidates rather than being falsely classified as DRM-free or guaranteed playable.
- Signal refuses explicit protected browser media before `play()` and makes decode/unsupported failures actionable: try another item or a native output.
- Signal Window 1.10.3.
- 262 tests pass.

# 6.2.2 — Stay Attached

- Signal Window 1.10.2 keeps the active browser `<video>` element continuously attached while its media card rerenders.
- Fixes Chromium `play() request was interrupted by a call to pause()` caused by Signal removing and reinserting its own playing video during UI refresh.
- Adds a regression that makes DOM attachment part of the browser-video lifecycle contract.
- Keeps the 6.2.1 cheap-failure intent and media diagnostics unchanged.

# 6.2.1 — Cheap Failure

- Fix LOOK/LO `lk` crash caused by a missing `shlex` import.
- Add explicit deterministic intent outcomes: `resolved`, `clarify`, and `no_match`; deictic requests such as `play that movie` now ask rather than becoming fake filenames.
- Harden Signal browser media startup: mount the presentation before play, suppress stale/aborted play promises, preserve source playback unless the browser actually starts, and distinguish aborted/network/decode/unsupported media failures.
- Signal Window 1.10.1 includes the browser media lifecycle repair.

# 6.2.0 — Common Tongue

- Added shared `fabric-intent-v1` deterministic normalization for obvious media commands.
- `play any movie`, `play a movie`, `play some music`, and `play something by ARTIST` now produce structured selectors rather than literal catalog queries.
- Signal Window 1.10.0 and terminal LO share the same intent normalizer.
- Media core now supports kind/artist/selection/limit selectors independently of natural language.
- Existing exact artist/album/title resolution remains unchanged.
- Kept transcoding out of this release; endpoint codec compatibility remains a separate capability concern.

# 6.1.19 — No Fixed Address

- Content identity is now distinct from physical file location.
- Duplicate-aware Fabric search groups identical indexed documents and reports all copies as locations.
- Signal Window 1.9.0 adds endpoint-local video playback over ranged Fabric streams.
- Identified media uses generic content-addressed artifact transport; large/unidentified media stays lazy.

# Future Crash + LOOK 6.1.18 — Lights Out

- Removed the installer pre-start localhost :7332 ownership gate. systemd/launchd own node lifecycle.
- Once the installer retires the managed node, any failed exit restores it on Linux or macOS.
- macOS recovery bootstraps the plist and falls back to kickstart if already loaded.
- No media, routing, Signal, Tailcat, or Fabric runtime behavior changes.

# Future Crash + LOOK 6.1.17 — Safe Harbor

- Installer shutdown verification probes only `127.0.0.1:7332`; Tailscale may legitimately listen on :7332 on tailnet addresses.
- Uses an exact localhost connect test instead of bind(), avoiding socket-teardown false positives.
- Failed upgrades restore a managed Unified Node that was running when installation began.

# Future Crash + LOOK 6.1.15 — Home Field

- Browser media commands now distinguish **origin endpoint**, **catalog/source node**, and **output target**.
- `This Device` is a true local output: a play request prepares a queue on the Fabric media source without ever launching that source node's player.
- Browser playback streams prepared entries by stable media ID, so it no longer depends on or mutates the source node's active queue.
- Explicit OUT selection still supports remote control (`play ... on 3090` / node target).
- Media receipts carry the authorized browser endpoint identity and explicit output target, laying the request-envelope foundation for capability routing and service failover.

# 6.1.14 — Unified Installer Repair

- Fixed the split installer regression that allowed LOOK/media to update while the resident Fabric node remained on an older release.
- `install-look.sh` now delegates direct invocations to the top-level unified installer; the unified installer marks its internal LOOK phase to avoid recursion.
- `install-look.sh` now derives the product release from the bundle `VERSION` file instead of carrying an independent hard-coded version.
- Unified install still verifies the installed and live node versions before completing.

# 6.1.13 — Transactional Node Upgrade

- Stops the managed Unified Node before replacing runtime source.
- Retires user-owned legacy node interpreters before install and proves localhost :7332 is free.
- Verifies both installed CLI and live API report the exact release before install succeeds.

# Changelog

## 6.1.10 — Media Mount Race Repair
- Preflight local media once per queue with a bounded sub-second retry window before resolving tracks.
- Keep local catalog entries local; transient filesystem/mount visibility can no longer turn an otherwise healthy album into a rapid 0:00 failure.
- Avoid per-track waiting: a genuinely unavailable 60-track volume costs about one second total, then fails clearly.

## 6.1.9 — Media Root Repair
- Refuse to proxy stale local media rows through localhost; missing local files are now reported as stale catalog paths.
- Add `lk media scan --relocate OLD_ROOT NEW_ROOT` to replace a moved/mounted media root without leaving duplicate stale entries.
- Use integer mpv IPC request IDs, removing the mpv 0.41 deprecation warning.


- Keep local media as native filesystem paths at the mpv edge instead of converting them to `file://` URIs.
- Capture the owned mpv worker log at `~/.local/share/look/media_mpv.log` rather than discarding decoder/player errors.
- Add `lk media doctor` (aliases: `diagnose`, `debug`) to show mpv/version, current source, byte size, a short decode probe, and recent player log.
- Preserve normal queue/session behavior; this release targets the observed 0:00 rapid-skip failure at the actual player/decoder edge.

## 6.1.7 — Media + Signal Repair

- Make ordinary media playback use stable catalog owner/id streaming through the loopback Unified Node instead of nested `fcl-node --json` identification.
- Add `/v1/media/item` GET/HEAD with Range support and authenticated Tailcat/Tailscale proxying for remote owners.
- Keep SHA/artifact promotion explicit; listening to a scanned file no longer requires hashing it first.
- Keep the Signal player card visible for a stopped-but-populated queue so `/player` is an inspector instead of a momentary flash.
- Stop Signal from drawing filler after routine media/control confirmations; generic visual fallback now abstains instead of emitting the recurring mountain-like micro-signal.
- Tell the visual reflex never to use generic mountain/sun/landscape motifs as filler.

## 6.1.6 — Fabric Client Authorization

- Teach the shared `fabric_client` to attach paired node authorization to every remote Fabric JSON and streaming inference request.
- Reuse the active Tailcat transport URL and pinned TLS context selected by the Unified Node instead of rebuilding remote inference URLs from Tailscale DNS alone.
- Apply the same authenticated transport path to artifact staging for vision requests.
- Preserve exact generated-image paths in Signal replies so follow-up browser requests retain a usable artifact reference.
- Update release-runtime coverage now that `fabric_client` formally depends on the installed Fabric identity module.

## 6.1.5 — Media Stream Edge Repair

- Stop resolving playable queue entries by shelling out to `fcl-node artifact` once per track. Identified media now receives a stable loopback media-proxy URL immediately.
- Add `/v1/media/artifact` to the Unified Node. The local node owns Fabric credentials, pinned TLS, Tailcat/Tailscale fallback, Range forwarding, and remote retries while mpv/Safari see a normal HTTP stream.
- Preserve lazy content identity: local filesystem bytes still win; only nonlocal/unavailable paths use the artifact proxy.
- Make JSON CLI decoding tolerant of bounded startup chatter and include the offending tail in diagnostics instead of returning the opaque `invalid JSON` error.
- Add regression coverage for proxy routing and for keeping authenticated peer URLs out of player queues.

## 6.1.4 — Media Resolver Repair

- Repair media playback from merged Fabric catalog rows: queue resolution now checks every physical location for local bytes before promoting a remote copy to content identity.
- Preserve transport-neutral queues while resolving remote media lazily through Fabric streams.
- Show the first concrete resolver failures when an entire queue is unplayable instead of only `no playable queue entries`.
- Normalize a leading conversational `the` for artist matching, so `play the talking heads` resolves the `Talking Heads` artist grouping.
- Treat an explicit `lk ...` line entered inside LO as an argv-safe LOOK command using the current TTY; it no longer falls through to model inference and Fabric authorization.
- Add regression coverage for article-normalized artist resolution, merged-location playback, failure diagnostics, and LO command passthrough.

## 6.1.3 — Tailcat Edge Repair

- Retry peer transports for endpoint approval/revoke when direct Tailcat fails.
- Restore authenticated remote browser audio across Fabric authorization.
- Add HEAD and streaming handling for media audio through ingress/Tailcat.

# 6.1.3 — Fabric Endpoint Route Repair

- Fix endpoint approval/revocation HTTP handlers accidentally registered in `GET` instead of `POST`.
- Restore `lk fabric allow CODE once|trust` locally and through Fabric-wide routing.
- Keep the 6.1.1 CLI fallback for mixed resident-process upgrade windows.

# 6.1.1 — Fabric Edge Repair

- Make Fabric endpoint approval resilient to a stale local node: the CLI can locate and approve a pending browser code across trusted peers when the local aggregate route returns 404.
- Mark Tailscale-only unpaired peers as `TAILSCALE*` in `lk fabric transport`, distinguishing discovery/fallback from a directly paired Tailcat relationship.
- Add `lk comfy unload` to release ComfyUI models and CUDA cache without stopping the service.
- Default LOOK-driven image generation to unload Comfy models after completion; configure with `lk comfy auto-unload on|off`.

# 6.1.0 — Tailcat Direct Transport

- Make browser endpoint management Fabric-wide: list, approve, and revoke from any reachable trusted node.
- Add Tailcat phase 1: direct certificate-pinned TLS Fabric transport on port 7443.
- Prefer Tailcat for paired peers and fall back to Tailscale when direct reachability is unavailable.
- Preserve the existing node authorization credential over both transports.
- Let existing 6.0 trust records learn Tailcat transport metadata from matching trusted peer identities without another re-pair.
- Add `lk fabric transport` diagnostics.
- Keep NAT traversal, relay, and browser remote reachability out of Tailcat phase 1.

# 6.0.0 — Fabric Authorization

- Enforce paired-node authorization on remotely reachable Fabric API routes.
- Mint reciprocal high-entropy peer credentials during pairing; keep public discovery/health/pairing routes minimal.
- Replace awkward copy/paste-first pairing with eight-digit one-use codes and `lk fabric pair NODE CODE`; keep QR transport optional.
- Add attempt limiting to pairing invitations.
- Add Signal Window 1.8.0 browser endpoint authorization with six-digit pending codes.
- Add `lk fabric endpoints`, `allow`, `revoke-endpoint`, and `endpoint-code`.
- Support allow-once, trust-device, revocation, one-use QR invitations, scoped endpoint credentials, and HttpOnly cookies.
- Preserve Tailscale as an optional transport rather than an identity/authorization provider.

# 5.9.0 — Fabric Identity

- Add a transport-independent Ed25519 identity to every Fabric node.
- Derive a stable `fcl-...` node ID and human-readable fingerprint from the public key.
- Add a local trust store with `lk fabric identity`, `lk fabric trust`, and `lk fabric untrust`.
- Add one-use, five-minute pairing invitations with strong short codes and `fcl://pair` URIs.
- Render a terminal QR code when optional `qrencode` is available; pairing itself has no QR dependency.
- Pairing exchanges and validates public identities over the currently reachable transport; Tailscale may carry the request but no longer defines Fabric identity.
- Keep trust non-enforcing for this migration release so existing Fabric nodes continue to interoperate; signed/scoped authorization is the next phase.

# 5.8.0 — Accountless Web Search

- Prefer Fabric/local SearXNG for generic web search; Ollama hosted search is optional fallback.
- Advertise `web.search` from nodes with a healthy local SearXNG edge.
- Route LO search through Fabric without requiring an Ollama account/API key.
- Rewrite README around the current architecture and reuse existing screenshots.
- Protect Dash on narrow terminal geometries.

## 5.7.2 — Find Retrieval Repair

- Fixed Unified Node query tokenization so Fabric file searches use real lexical terms instead of degrading into newest-file listings.
- Plain lexical misses now return zero results; unconstrained catalog listings remain available only for explicit metadata intents such as `recent` or `biggest`.
- `lk find` now opens an interactive paged result chooser on a TTY, with filtering, navigation, snippet preview, and path copy.
- Accepting a locally reachable result hands it to the normal LOOK file view, where existing preview/mark/copy/move/remove/LO actions apply. Remote/unmounted Fabric results remain safe and are never treated as local paths.

## 5.7.1 — Smart Resolver

- Preserves 5.7.0 Fabric Content Search and adds deterministic catalog-backed target resolution for open/preview/reveal.
- Adds quoted-phrase directory hints and ambiguity-safe resolution.

# 5.7.0 — Fabric Content Search

The ordinary-file catalog now has a deliberately boring second layer: bounded deterministic text extraction plus SQLite FTS5. `lk scan` still owns discovery, but changed supported documents are now text-indexed incrementally; unchanged documents are not re-read. No embeddings, OCR, model calls, or hashing are part of indexing.

Supported content sources are plain text/Markdown, source and common config formats, HTML, DOCX, EPUB, and text-bearing PDFs. HTML/script noise is stripped, DOCX/EPUB use their standard ZIP/XML/HTML containers, and PDF extraction uses the already-installed Poppler `pdftotext` edge. Files over 4 MiB are left metadata-only and extracted text is capped at 256 KiB per file.

`lk find` now combines filename/path matches with FTS5 content matches and shows a short evidence snippet. Natural queries such as `lk find "where was that thing I wrote about GDP countermeasure happiness"` work without embeddings. Fabric search remains data-local: every node searches its own SQLite database and returns only bounded matches/snippets, never its full text index.

This establishes the cheap content layer for later artifact identity, data-local job placement, and optional semantic search without making those expensive mechanisms prerequisites.

# 5.6.1 — File Catalog Concurrency Repair

- Fixed SQLite lock race between installer/background scan and manual `lk scan`.
- Added SQLite busy timeout, migration-only schema version writes, and single-crawler locking.
- Concurrent manual scans now report `scan already running` while searches remain available.

# 5.6.0 — Fabric File Catalog

LOOK now maintains a lightweight SQLite metadata catalog for ordinary files, extending the media-catalog lesson to the rest of the filesystem. `lk scan [ROOT]` records paths, names, extensions, sizes and modification times without reading or hashing file contents; a bare `lk scan` uses the home directory with conservative cache/build/hidden-directory exclusions. `lk catalog` reports local coverage and `lk find QUERY` accepts useful plain-language metadata terms such as `pdf`, `recent`, `yesterday`, and `largest`.

Each Unified Node publishes its local catalog through `/v1/files/catalog`; `/v1/files/fabric` unions currently reachable node catalogs. `lk find` prefers that Fabric union when the node is available and falls back to the local SQLite catalog in Island Mode. Paths remain node-owned metadata: cataloging never grants new filesystem access and never transfers file bytes.

Fresh installs seed the first home metadata scan in the background. Expensive identity, content extraction, FTS and semantic understanding remain deliberately deferred layers rather than costs paid during discovery.

# 5.5.0 — Media Endpoint Handoff

Signal media output routing is now explicit: browser playback is a local browser endpoint and never enters Fabric media-move dispatch, while node-to-node handoff uses the Fabric route. Cross-node queues are rewritten to range-capable source-node stream URLs so a Mac can play a 3090 library without sharing `/srv` paths or copying the track first. Signal uses stable endpoint buttons rather than an iOS native select picker, and node HTTP errors preserve their real diagnostic instead of collapsing to `Fabric media move unavailable`.

# 5.4.9 — Stable Safari Output Picker

- Keep Signal OUT selector DOM-stable while native Safari picker is active.
- Media polling continues observing state but cannot redraw the picker out from under iOS.
- Change commits normally; blur performs one reconciliation render.

# 5.4.8 — Media Output State Repair

- Replace competing Signal media-output state with one authoritative target: `browser` or `node:<id>`.
- Suspend media polling during browser handoff; polling observes state and never chooses the output.
- Avoid rebuilding the native iOS `<select>` during its `change` event while Safari dismisses the picker.
- Commit browser playback before stopping the source node; source-stop failure becomes a warning rather than rolling back into duplicate playback.
- Treat node playback availability as a capability (LOOK + mpv), not as the existence of an already-active local media session. Freshly upgraded Macs can therefore advertise as valid outputs before playing anything.
- Keep node option values namespaced so `This Device` and a Fabric node can never both represent the same selected value.

# 5.4.7 — Media Endpoint + Dash Input Hygiene

- Make Signal browser-output handoff transactional: **This Device / This iPhone** claims the card immediately while Safari starts playback, so background media polling cannot snap the selector back to the source node.
- Stream proxied media audio incrementally through Signal and remote Fabric nodes instead of buffering an entire track before Safari receives bytes.
- Keep browser playback failure reversible: the source node remains authoritative until browser audio starts, and the selector restores the source with a visible error if Safari rejects playback.
- Treat beacon/RGB/pulse records as renderer effects rather than RECENT semantic work in Dash.
- Consume ANSI cursor/mouse/scroll escape sequences as terminal input, preventing arrow-down (`ESC [ B`) and terminal gestures from becoming the `B` beacon hotkey.
- Rate-limit the Dash beacon hotkey so key repeat cannot launch overlapping diagnostic shows.
- Update help/docs/version surfaces and add endpoint/Dash regression coverage.

# 5.4.6 — Endpoint Media Cleanup

- Move Signal media output selection from the chat composer onto the active media card.
- Add ephemeral **This Device** / **This iPhone** browser audio playback without treating browsers as full Fabric compute nodes.
- Add range-capable Fabric media audio streaming and queue-index-preserving handoff between browser and node playback endpoints.
- Surface concrete output availability reasons such as `mpv missing` instead of unexplained disabled nodes.
- Promote `mpv` to a standard LOOK workstation dependency so fresh installs and upgrades automatically enable media playback on Macs and Linux nodes.
- Update Signal help, docs, release/version surfaces, and regression coverage.

# 5.4.5 — Node-Scoped Media Outputs

- Split Fabric media session meaning from node-specific playback output. Each reachable node advertises a default `media.playback` / queue / control endpoint.
- Add routed media state/control/play APIs and session handoff between nodes; moving output preserves queue/current index and stops the old playback worker only after the target accepts the session.
- Add Signal **OUT** chooser, per-node queue/player state, deterministic selected-node `play ...` routing, and shared controls against the selected output.
- Add `lk media outputs` and `lk media on NODE ...` deterministic operator surfaces.
- Fix iPhone camera prompt selection: `what am I looking at?` is real preselected composer text, so Return accepts it and typing replaces it.
- Update help, completion, man page, command/reference docs, installer/version surfaces, and tests.

# 5.4.4 — Signal Camera + Service-Safe Media

- Add Signal 1.4.0 camera/photo attachment from the chat input using the browser's native rear-camera capture surface.
- Treat camera photos as ordinary resources: Signal materializes bytes locally, LO selects the image path, and Fabric stages the image as an artifact for vision inference.
- Keep the 524288-byte Fabric ingress boundary intact; camera image bytes are not embedded in work packets.
- Make LOOK mpv discovery robust under systemd/launchd service PATHs, including Linuxbrew, Homebrew, and normal system locations.
- Preserve the real media edge diagnostic in LO/Signal when playback fails instead of returning only `MEDIA PLAY FAILED`.
- Add defensive PATH configuration to the Signal service edge while retaining runtime discovery/fallback.
- Update Signal help, install banners, release/version surfaces, documentation, and tests.

# 5.4.3 — Signal Media Card

- Add Signal 1.3.0 live media card over LOOK's canonical MediaSession.
- Auto-discover playback started from any local LOOK/LO surface; browser ownership is never required.
- Add previous, play/pause, next, stop, expandable queue, and exact queue-item jump controls.
- Add renderer-neutral `lk media state` JSON snapshot and deterministic `lk media jump INDEX`.
- Keep mpv/LOOK as the sole playback owner; dismissing or closing Signal leaves playback untouched.
- Update help, command grammar, man page, Signal docs, completions, release history, installer banners, and version surfaces.

# 5.4.2 — Island Resilience + Workstation Editor

- Add `lk doctor island`, a loopback-only single-node autonomy audit for local LOOK, Ollama, memory, media, and optional OpenJev.
- Codify the one-node Fabric invariant: remote workers increase capability but are not a prerequisite for local LOOK/LO operation.
- Repair Future Crash Ask/Workstation editing so the logical input buffer and cursor are authoritative; every frame redraws the fixed-width editor viewport, eliminating stale glyphs and phantom right-column deletion.
- Document Backspace/Delete and left/right/Home/End cursor behavior in Future Crash help.
- Synchronize README, command reference, command grammar, man page, completions, architecture, release history, and installer/version surfaces.

# 5.4.0 — Canonical Decision Worker

- Promote the Decision Plane into normal Fabric cognition: deterministic fast paths, learned judgment, human clarification, and graceful fallbacks share one policy path.
- OpenJev is now an optional first-class decision worker with config, health, systemd lifecycle, installer adoption/install modes, capability discovery, and Local Labs server controls.
- LO media ambiguity can use OpenJev live while exact controls remain deterministic and instantaneous.
- Decision telemetry records probability distribution, top-two margin, confidence, latency, policy disposition, and provider failures for later evaluation.
- Dash adds cognition/decision visibility and semantic JUDGE / ASK / ACT feedback without turning uncertainty into a blocking UI.
- Missing, disabled, or failed OpenJev degrades to existing deterministic/LLM behavior; it is never a hard dependency.

# 5.3.2 — Decision Interaction

- Make `lk fabric ask` interactive in a TTY while remaining renderer-neutral: terminal, Signal, or another Fabric surface may answer the same pending decision.
- Poll while waiting so a Signal answer immediately releases the originating terminal; bare Enter leaves the decision pending instead of blocking.
- Add the obvious `lk play TARGET` shorthand and route it directly to the existing LOOK media session instead of falling through to the file renderer.
- Keep decision deadlines/fallback policy authoritative in Fabric; the terminal is only another optional consumer.

# 5.3.0 — Decision Plane

- Human clarification becomes a renderer-neutral Fabric object instead of a blocking terminal prompt.
- Decisions carry confidence, consequence, reversibility, deadline, preferred choice, and timeout policy.
- Power/Unsafe can auto-continue only low-consequence reversible work; Workspace/Conservative defer; consequential/irreversible work requires explicit confirmation and cancels on silence.
- Pending decisions aggregate across trusted nodes and can be answered from terminal or Signal.
- Continuation work re-enters the normal Fabric Work Packet authorization path; UI surfaces never execute work directly.
- Adds an optional OpenJev-compatible shadow adapter at `/v1/decisions/shadow` with no model/runtime dependency.
- Signal 1.2.0 adds a compact decision card with countdown and one-tap answers.

# 5.2.19 — Media Session Reliability

- Reuse the LOOK-owned mpv process for ordinary play requests instead of spawning overlapping players.
- Add deterministic first/last/first-on-album media controls for LO.
- Make selector queue mutation canonical-only so Q returns immediately without stream resolution or player I/O.
- Preserve MediaSession as the owner of queue state; mpv remains a playback worker.

# 5.2.18 — LO Media Tools + LOOK Media Filter

- Added first-class LO media tools: `media_search`, `media_play`, `media_queue`, and `media_control`.
- Added conservative deterministic preflight for narrow local media commands so `lo play Talking Heads` cannot drift into web search.
- Kept explicit online/video requests on the existing web-resource path.
- Reworked `lk media find` around LOOK filter semantics with immediate filtering and Tab multi-select.
- Added contextual uppercase selector actions: play, queue, queue visible matches, info, save playlist, and clear selection.
- Kept exact catalog/artifact rows underneath human-readable labels.
- Added regression coverage for LO media routing and selector semantics.

# 5.2.17 — Fabric Media Catalog + LOOK Selector

- Replace the awkward print-then-retype media search flow with a LOOK-native interactive selector: Enter plays, Space appends to the canonical queue, `A` plays the visible match set, `/` refines the filter, and `I` shows lightweight identity/format detail. Non-interactive output remains plain text.
- Add a Fabric-wide media catalog assembled from currently reachable trusted nodes. `lk media fabric` reports logical items, physical scanned locations, per-node counts, and progressive SHA identification state.
- Add generic artifact catalog endpoints (`/v1/artifacts` and `/v1/artifacts/fabric`) so SHA-addressed files have a discoverable Fabric registry beyond the media demo.
- Add progressive media identity. Fast scans still avoid hashing; `lk media identify QUERY|PATH|--all` promotes discovered files to SHA-256 artifacts. Bulk `--all` is deliberately node-local, while a selected remote item can be identified on demand by its source node.
- Preserve SHA identity across rescans only when size and mtime still match; changed files fall back to discovered/unidentified state rather than retaining stale content identity.
- Merge duplicate online copies by SHA while preserving location lists and preferring a local copy for playback. Unidentified look-alikes never deduplicate merely by filename.
- Feed zsh media completion from the same online catalog, bounded to a small candidate set of artists, albums, and titles.
- Keep queue/session ownership in LOOK and decoding in mpv; no recommendation engine, artwork system, ratings database, or fixed media-root worldview was added.

# 5.2.16 — Media Sessions + Library Queue

- Add dependency-free `look/media_core.py`: the queue/library model is pure logic; playback, filesystem, terminal, and Fabric transport remain edges.
- Add fast `lk media scan ROOT` indexing with no full-file hashing or decoding, plus `library`, `find`, `artists`, and `albums` views. No media root or storage layout is hard-coded.
- Add persistent LOOK-owned `MediaSession` queues, directory/album/artist/query playback, `--shuffle`, queue inspection, repeat-all, and clear/restart behavior.
- Keep mpv as the optional dumb playback engine. LOOK mirrors its canonical queue into an M3U8 runtime edge and reconciles live playlist position back into MediaSession.
- Add saved queue playlists (`save`, `load`, `playlists`, and `playlist ...`) that exclude player PID/socket/runtime state so they survive ordinary restarts and remain repairable after storage moves.
- Add `lk player`, a tiny live terminal miniplayer with progress, queue position, seek, previous/next, repeat, stop, and close-without-stopping controls.
- Preserve generic artifact transport. Same-node queues may use direct local file URIs; `lk media stream` explicitly exercises Fabric registration/range streaming, and remote digest entries still use Fabric streams.

# 5.2.15 — Streaming Artifacts + Media Proof

- Generalize Fabric artifacts beyond small in-memory blobs: existing large files can be registered in place by SHA-256 without copying them into the Fabric state directory. Physical path remains a node-local location, while the artifact digest is the logical identity.
- Add HTTP `HEAD` and single-range `GET` support (`Accept-Ranges`, `206`, `Content-Range`) for artifacts so large audio/video/data files can seek and stream without whole-file downloads or RAM buffering.
- File-backed artifacts fail closed if their observed size/mtime changes after registration; re-registering establishes a new content identity/location record. Public artifact metadata never exposes the node-local source path.
- Nodes now advertise `artifact.read`, `artifact.range`, and `artifact.stream` as generic capabilities. Media is the proof case, not a special storage architecture.
- Extend `fcl-node` with `artifact-add` and `artifact` inspection/URL commands, including peer stream URL resolution.
- Extend `lk media`: existing no-argument transport controls remain compatible, while `lk media add PATH`, `lk media play PATH`, `lk media play @NODE sha256:DIGEST`, and `lk media info` exercise Fabric artifact transport.
- Prefer optional `mpv` as the dumb playback edge. LOOK launches it with a local JSON IPC socket so the existing play/pause/next/previous/stop controls can operate the LOOK-owned stream session; VLC/system playback remains a fallback.
- Do not introduce a media-library database, fixed `/mnt/music` path, transcoder, codec stack, or storage layout. The coming 3090 storage audit can reorganize physical disks without changing the artifact/stream contract.

# 5.2.14 — Shared Fabric UI Model

- Added `core/ui_model.py`: a renderer-neutral presentation model for nodes, capabilities, jobs, services, recent events, and actions.
- Dash controls now render from the shared action registry instead of duplicating their semantics in terminal code.
- Dash full/wide views expose a compact capability summary, so the UI begins reflecting Fabric as a graph of capabilities rather than only machines/services.
- Added `GET /v1/ui/state`, a stable `fabric-ui-v1` JSON surface for Signal and future renderers; no HTML, ANSI, or terminal assumptions leak into the model.
- This is an incremental mainline change, not a UI rewrite: existing Dash/LOOK/Future Crash behavior and hotkeys remain intact.

# 5.2.13 — Vision Runtime Fix

- Fix vision artifact hydration on the Unified Node by importing Python's `base64` module at runtime before converting artifact bytes into Ollama image payloads.
- Add a regression test that exercises the runtime symbol used by the artifact-to-vision bridge, preventing this NameError from returning.
- No scheduler, artifact format, packet-size, or model-curation behavior changed.

# 5.2.12 — Interactive Reliability

- Keep `lk dash` alive when Ctrl-C is used to leave Watch. The LOOK launcher now lets the dashboard/watch child own SIGINT and continues waiting instead of surfacing a parent `KeyboardInterrupt` traceback.
- Treat inference HTTP 409 `worker busy` as temporary capacity pressure for interactive work. Routing still tries distinct workers first, then uses a short bounded grace window with fresh placement snapshots before declaring the Fabric unavailable. Background work continues to fail fast.
- Make streaming inference lease cleanup exception-safe across the entire post-acquire path, including model discovery and vision-artifact hydration, so a pre-stream failure cannot leave a ghost BUSY worker behind.
- Add regression coverage for bounded busy retry, dashboard Ctrl-C ownership, and final streaming-lease cleanup.

# 5.2.11 — Live Tail + Vision Artifacts

- Move LO vision pixels out of Fabric work packets. The selected worker receives image data through the content-addressed artifact endpoint, while the inference packet carries only SHA-256 artifact references; the worker rehydrates images only at its Ollama edge.
- Preserve the 512 KiB Fabric packet guard instead of hiding oversized vision requests by raising it.
- Make `lk fabric watch` join the current event tail on first contact rather than starting at sequence zero and draining an overnight backlog. A live watch only follows cursor events accumulated during that watch session.
- Bound the operational Fabric event ledger to seven days / 20,000 rows, pruned incrementally, so disconnected clients cannot create permanent replay debt or an ever-growing event database.
- Keep explicit event history available through the retained ledger while making live-vs-history semantics distinct.

# 5.2.10 — Isolated Model Qualification

- Make `lk ollama test --all` a comparable per-node sweep: one target model resident at a time, canonical 4096 context, one discarded stabilization pass, then three identical warm samples with median TTFT/generation rate.
- Report cold model load time separately from warm TTFT, plus Ollama's achieved GPU residency percentage when available.
- Add a local benchmark guard so the background qualifier, adaptive curator, and Fabric job worker cannot silently alter Ollama residency during a benchmark sweep. The guard has a TTL and is released in `finally`.
- Restore the exact pre-sweep resident model names instead of loading only the selected/default model afterward.
- Keep enable/disable policy node-local: each node's curator now reports its eligible and disabled model sets explicitly, making machine-specific curation visible.
- Persist benchmark scope, load time, GPU share, and raw warm samples alongside capability evidence for later platform/model policy decisions.

# 5.2.9 — Ollama Command Dispatch Fix

- Fixed `lk ollama curate ...` and `lk ollama warm ...` being mistaken for long-form LO chat prompts before the Ollama subcommand dispatcher could see them.
- Added a release regression test covering every first-class Ollama management subcommand that must bypass chat dispatch.
- No curator policy, model residency, benchmark, or Fabric scheduling behavior changed.

# 5.2.8 — Adaptive Model Curator

- Replace the first resident-set concurrency probe with stabilized 4096-context, repeated median measurements and a physical sanity bound; impossible >N× results are no longer scored.
- Add an evidence-driven model curator that plans canonical resident sets from installed model size, local benchmark evidence, current non-Ollama GPU pressure, and platform memory budget.
- Add `lk ollama curate`, `lk ollama curate --apply`, and opt-in `lk ollama curate auto on|off`; automatic mode reserves a deep worker for deep interactive work and returns to a balanced medium+small set when idle.
- Add `lk ollama warm MODEL...` using the canonical 4096 context.
- Respect LOOK-disabled models during curation and keep large deep models alone when their footprint would otherwise force unhealthy mixed residency.
- Let Fabric routing use benchmark role evidence as a placement hint while preserving hard capability requirements, live latency, residency, load, and node availability.

# 5.2.7 — Model Roles + Resident Sets

- Replace opaque multi-model `R2` residency with compact identities such as `R[q3:8b,g3:1b]`.
- Extend manual model benchmarks with three deterministic reasoning probes and preserve raw role evidence instead of inventing one universal model score.
- Add `lk ollama test --resident-set` to compare sequential vs concurrent response of the models already warm in Ollama; it never cold-loads or evicts a model.
- Surface purpose evidence in `lk fabric models` and compact Dash model summaries.
- Reserve a physical right-edge gutter in full Dash so the PULSE column is not clipped by terminal last-cell behavior.

# 5.2.6 — Adaptive Dash Geometry

- Replace coarse height breakpoints with fit-first responsive layout selection.
- Add a landscape renderer that spends horizontal width to preserve node/model, jobs, trust, control, service, ingress, and RECENT evidence in short terminals.
- Let RECENT consume spare rows instead of leaving large blank regions in medium windows.
- Preserve the full diagnostic renderer whenever it physically fits; Mini remains an explicit operator mode, not an automatic fallback.
- Keep model qualification and benchmark evidence unchanged.

# 5.2.5 — Responsive Dash + Benchmark Evidence

- Make live Dash height-aware: full, condensed, and compact compositions fit the terminal rectangle without paging.
- Protect RECENT and controls as terminal height shrinks; secondary telemetry compresses first.
- Keep `lk dash --snapshot`/non-TTY rendering full for copyable diagnostics.
- Persist LOOK model benchmark evidence and advertise local results alongside lightweight background qualification.
- Extend `lk fabric models` with benchmark fit, tool, agent, and exact-response evidence.
- Preserve Mini, Beacon, Lights, semantic event colors, and non-blocking keyboard behavior.

# 5.2.4 — Model Observability

- Dash MODEL cells now distinguish configured model, residency, qualification freshness, and measured generation rate instead of an ambiguous `*`.
- `lk fabric models [NODE]` exposes resident/available state, tested/untested/stale/failed qualification, TTFT, generation speed, and exact READY compliance.
- Background qualification remains opportunistic: resident models only, 20 seconds idle, once per 24 hours, and preemptible by interactive work.

# 5.2.3 — Dash Polish

- RECENT uses the same semantic color vocabulary as ambient activity flashes.
- Mini Dash (`m`) provides a compact activity instrument for small terminal windows.
- Removed broken Freeze and redundant Activity Color hotkeys; ambient colors are normal Dash behavior.
- Beacon and Lights remain explicit Fabric-wide test/demo controls.
- Quiet events may remain visible in RECENT without flashing; stream/token noise stays suppressed.

# 5.2.2 — Ambient Fabric

- `lk dash` now uses brief, restrained whole-terminal color flashes as passive Fabric telemetry: blue dispatch, amber inference, cyan capability/memory work, green success, red failure/cancel, purple general/remote work.
- Activity colors are derived from canonical Fabric events; producers never emit terminal-color instructions. Repeated stream/chunk events are deliberately ignored so Dash does not strobe.
- `a` toggles activity colors without affecting the existing synchronized Beacon or Light Demo.
- RECENT is now explicitly `RECENT · OBSERVED BY THIS NODE` and labels each event LOCAL or REMOTE. Cross-day events show a weekday/time so stale activity cannot look current merely because the live clock is ticking.
- Added `docs/GREENFIELD_FORK.md`, preserving the post-5.2 counterfactual design work without changing production architecture: distinct LOOK/LO/Future Crash/Signal projects, heterogeneous workers beyond Ollama, dual-resident model experiments, ephemeral browser/WebGPU workers, small-model cognitive maintenance, provenance, Show Work, and ambient observability.
- No rename of Fabric in production. Naming remains an experimental-fork decision.

# 5.2.1 — Evidence Labels + Ask Flow

- Future Crash Ask and Workstation now surface the provenance emitted by LOOK's canonical engine.
- Sourced turns show the canonical edge/provider receipt; turns without a source receipt are explicitly labeled `MODEL · INFERRED`.
- Provenance describes evidence origin, not probability or confidence percentage.
- `lo_engine.chat_once()` now returns structured `receipts` and a canonical `provenance` summary for native interfaces.
- Future Crash Answer view is conversational again: begin typing to start the next Ask question; Ctrl-C is not required.
- Signal/compiler telemetry remains separate from conversation provenance.

# Future Crash + LOOK 5.2.0 — Personas + Fabric Memory

## One brain path, many faces

- Future Crash Ask and X Workstation now use LOOK's canonical native LO/Fabric engine for normal conversation.
- Oracle is now a persona, not a model or host. The conductor may route Oracle turns to any suitable Fabric worker.
- Future Crash inherits trusted temporal grounding, canonical tool edges, LO memory retrieval, and canonical visible-text extraction.
- User/session access profile remains independent from personality. Oracle does not gain power merely by being Oracle.
- The Future Crash header now reports `ORACLE · FABRIC:AUTO · <PROFILE>` rather than pretending Oracle is one local model.

## Persona registry

- Added `oracle` and `pirate` to the existing `lo`, `robot`, `max`, and `philosopher` registry.
- Native `lo_engine.chat_once(..., persona=...)` supports a per-call persona override without changing the user's saved default.

## Fabric Memory v1

- Added `core/memory_store.py`: small JSON-backed scoped memory.
- Scopes: `shared`, `persona:<name>`, and non-replicating `node:<name>`.
- Unified Node exposes `/v1/memory` for add/merge/sync.
- Explicit peer sync is bounded and last-write-wins; node-local memories never replicate.
- LOOK injects relevant shared/persona/node memory alongside its existing durable local memory.
- New commands: `lk memory fabric`, `shared`, `persona`, `local`, `add-shared`, `add-persona`, `add-local`, and `sync`.

## Compatibility

- Existing LO memory remains intact.
- Existing Future Crash compact local memory remains intact and is supplied as Oracle-local context.
- Ambient, fortune, threads, and Signal compilation keep their specialized lightweight paths.

## 7.5.0 — ALBERT TRUST
- Persistent server-owned Albert thread continuity across browser views/restarts.
- Trust/evidence badges derived from LO receipts and provenance; model synthesis is never verified.
- Additive typed clarification and Signal presentation fields in Albert's response envelope.
- Removed the mandatory startup greeting fold; status remains visible without polluting conversation history.

## 8.2.0 — FABRIC EVERYWHERE
- Bounded/failure-safe LOOK previews and clean interrupt handling.
- Zero-touch removable-drive media discovery on every Fabric node.
- Larger old-school terminal game boards; GTNW behavior frozen.

## 8.3.20 — PACKAGE REPAIR
- Fixes 8.3.18 installer omission of `media_art.py`, which caused installed `lk` to fail at startup and post-install verification to report `unavailable`.
- Adds install-manifest regression coverage for LOOK Python module imports.
