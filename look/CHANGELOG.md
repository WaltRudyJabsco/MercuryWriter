# 4.55.0 — FABRIC VISION

- Extend `lk vision` with local/remote desktop capture, terminal preview, explicit persistence, and in-memory model analysis.
- Add foreground-only bounded watch sessions with hash-based unchanged-frame suppression.
- Preserve the existing `lk vision IMAGE [QUESTION]` behavior.

# 4.54.1 — MEDIA PLAYER

- Add `lk mp`, the integrated LOOK media workspace over the existing Fabric catalog, MediaSession, remote preview and mpv transport layers.
- `/` enters explicit search mode; Library/Queue switching and transport remain unambiguous outside text entry.
- Preserve `lk media find` and `lk player` as focused views over the same backend.

# 4.53.5 — MEDIA FINISH

- Media Find row-by-row erase semantics fix stale terminal artifacts.
- Remote artwork resolution is asynchronous, latest-selection-wins, and visibly reports loading/unavailable state.
- Remote and local Chafa cover rendering use explicit full RGB output.

- Eliminate Media Find clear-to-blank navigation redraws.
- Route remote terminal art through the same proven Fabric identity as playback.
- Add `s` shuffle toggle to `lk player`.

# 7.5.5 — ATTENTION ROUTER

- Fixes `lk voice preview` and the Settings preview row so they audition the configured default voice rather than a personality override.
- Adds typed Fabric attention events and explicit endpoint-aware voice routing through `lk alert [@TARGET] MESSAGE`.
- Supports origin, named nodes/endpoints, and `@all`; reserves `@active`/`@follow-me` without guessing presence.
- Reuses canonical node speech and authorized browser endpoint receipts instead of creating a second delivery system.
- Records Albert map consistency and natural-media parity as dedicated follow-up targets rather than patching them ad hoc.

# 7.5.3 — LOOK FEEL

- Makes Nerd Font file/folder glyphs the default LOOK presentation; Classic remains selectable.
- Adds image preview modes: Auto, Graphics, ASCII, and Off. Auto prefers Kitty/iTerm2/Sixel through Chafa only when the terminal advertises support, with symbol fallback.
- Expands feedback sound to Off/Subtle/Expressive. Sounds follow semantic receipts, not navigation keystrokes.
- Adds shared Fabric voice presets (Albert, Warm, Crisp, Deep, Max, Philosopher, Pirate, WOPR), personality voice overrides, and a voice preview action in `lk settings`.
- Preserves the 7.5.2 browse invariant: paging scans without selecting; Up/Down establishes object selection; Enter filters when neutral and opens when selected.

# 7.5.2 — LOOK FLOW

A focused LOOK interaction release.

- Up/Down from the ordinary unfiltered browse surface now enters a one-object browse cursor instead of scrolling the rendered screen by one line.
- The cursor follows LOOK display order and preserves the static multi-column grid.
- Enter/Right opens the highlighted object; Left remains parent/back.
- Page Up/Page Down, Space/B, Shift-Up/Down, Shift-Left/Right, g, and G retain their established page/end semantics.
- Filter/select mode retains the one-candidate-per-row invariant.
- Optional Nerd Font file icons are available in `lk settings`; classic ◆/· markers remain the default.
- Release packages exclude Python bytecode caches.

# 7.5.2 — ALBERT SOURCES

Albert saved objects, source provenance, and place/map rendering.

# 7.5.0 — OBSERVATION PLANE

- Live State is now refreshed from read-only OS observation where available, not only from LOOK's own action receipts.
- `what windows are open` is a deterministic state query.
- `run another in a new terminal` resolves `another` relationally against the prior runnable object.
- `close the first ascii window` resolves by filtering current live objects and applying an ordinal relation.
- Stale unrefreshable objects age out; observed focus can supersede stale action recency.
- `lk state` refreshes the observed scene before display.

# 7.3.0 — LIVE STATE

- Added bounded present-tense state plates separate from durable world receipts.
- JEV referents resolve against live objects; close receipts retire objects immediately.
- Current/salient and `the other one` relations are deterministic when the live scene supports them.
- Relevant LIVE STATE is injected into cognition with source/age provenance.
- Added `lk state` observability.

# 7.2.0 — CAPABILITY CURATOR

- JEV typed referents can now maximize, fullscreen, focus, minimize, and close known terminal windows.
- Capability discovery is automatic; normal users do not configure adapters manually.
- Linux launched terminals receive stable window tokens and a bounded control channel.
- `lk capabilities` shows discovered/proven adapters and receipt counts.

# 7.1.0 — JEV FABRIC

- Universal JEV-0 deterministic intent layer plus optional local JEV-1 learned judgment.
- Explicit image generation owns its prompt before WEATHER routing.
- Normalize conversational glue/self-address for deterministic actions.
- Resolve unique recent typed-object aliases/prefixes while refusing ambiguity.
- Add Linux/macOS JEV-1 lifecycle support and capability diagnostics.

# 7.0.5 — TYPED REFERENTS

- Host actions can now produce typed referent objects carried in authoritative receipts.
- New-terminal launches produce a `terminal_window` referent with a host-close handle.
- JEV resolves narrow deictic follow-ups such as `close that window` before cognition.
- Linux records the inside-terminal process PID; macOS records Terminal's window ID.
- `close_object` is a typed host primitive, eliminating the prior `run_command` → file-dispatch failure.
- Ambiguous compatible referents fall back to cognition instead of guessing.
- Adds end-to-end regressions for the exact launch/close continuity failure.

# 7.0.4 — JEV WIRED

- Fix JEV loading after installation by ensuring the unified installer deploys the shared JEV core module.
- Add installed-layout regression coverage.

## 6.9.0 — COGNITIVE FABRIC

- Enforce speech effects through `audio_speak` receipts; repair narrow printed pseudo-calls once.
- Resolve verified anaphoric home/default-location memory synchronously with host receipts.
- Add `lk ollama set` named sets, champion/challenger labels and comparisons.
- Add model Fabric Fit benchmark evidence and feed it to curator role selection.
- Add evidence authority and explicit persistent-goal wake/close semantics.

## 6.8.1 — MODEL GROUND TRUTH

- Route explainer is exposed through `lk fabric route`.

## 6.8.0 — MODEL GROUND TRUTH

- Curated role defaults, route evidence freshness and Dash curator telemetry.

## 6.7.6 — CANONICAL EDGE
- Canonicalize full US state names before WEATHER/PLACE lookup (`portland oregon` → `portland, Oregon`).
- Apply canonicalization inside `_weather_lookup` so model-issued tool calls and deterministic preflight cannot diverge across nodes.
- Preserve transactional home teaching and live-receipt trust boundaries.

## 6.7.6 — CANONICAL EDGE

- Isolate live-edge evidence contracts at the turn boundary.
- Validate clarification-derived home locations before durable memory writes.
- Terminate simple clock/date questions at host truth.

## 6.7.3 — LET GO

- Harden persistent goal/slot lifecycle so stale WEATHER state cannot capture unrelated turns.
- Distinguish waiting-for-human from running-at-edge state.
- Retire failed weather invocations and structurally reject new intent as a location-slot answer.

## 6.7.2 — STAY AWAKE

- Persistent working-state goals/slots and `lk brain`.
- Home/weather continuation survives process boundaries and promotes explicit corrections immediately.
- Larger retained recent memory with bounded prompt retrieval.

## 6.7.0 — BEACON

- Added `lk fabric rendezvous status|set URL|off|sync|announce|resolve`.
- Fabric can learn signed short-lived Tailcat candidates independently of Tailscale discovery.

## 6.6.5 — PICTURE LOCK

- Native mpv video launches no longer pass `--video=yes`; current mpv accepts `auto`, `no`, or explicit track IDs, so LOOK leaves automatic track selection at the mpv default.
- Video launches still force an immediate window for truthful startup behavior.

## 6.4.9 — BROWSER VOICE

- Browser sessions are first-class Fabric effect endpoints with live presence and capability advertisement.
- Authorized Albert and Signal browsers can receive `audio.speak` actions and synthesize speech locally.
- `lk fabric speak @ipad ...` can resolve an active browser endpoint when no full node matches.
- Albert now uses the shared accountless Fabric endpoint authorization gate before cognition/effect actions.

## 6.4.8 — SOUND CHECK

- Fixed Fabric speech under Linux systemd by teaching canonical service binary discovery about Linuxbrew (`/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin` and `~/.linuxbrew/bin`). Interactive WOPR voice and `/v1/audio/speak` now resolve the same eSpeak NG/SoX binaries.

## 6.4.7 — VOICEPRINT

- Fabric-backed `audio.speak` capability with eSpeak NG + SoX WOPR profile on macOS and Linux.
- Games route voice through Fabric first and use the same local pipeline as fallback.
- Added sparse spoken WOPR greeting/outcome lines; GTNW keeps its own dramatic behavior.

## 6.4.6 — FALKEN

- LOOK Games board polish: checkerboard-backed chess/checkers with edge coordinates and a real backgammon board with round checkers, bar, points, dice, and borne-off counts.
- `q`/Esc returns board games to the WOPR simulation menu; `s` remains a true stop. GTNW keeps its own exit semantics.
- The WOPR `LOGON: JOSHUA` ritual now appears on every game entrance, including bare `lk games`, which still deadpans `NO GAMES INSTALLED.` afterward.
- Lightweight WOPR voice: macOS uses the built-in Zarvox `say` voice; Linux uses `espeak-ng` with SoX processing when available. Set `LOOK_GAMES_VOICE=0` to mute it.
- Workstation dependencies now include SoX everywhere and `espeak-ng` on Linux.

## 6.4.4 — LOOK Games

- Added `lk games` WOPR recreation channel with Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, Chess, Backgammon, and GTNW.
- Board games support 0p/1p/2p and share stop/restart/help controls.
- Preserved `lk ttt` and `lk gtnw` aliases.

## 6.4.3 — Searchlight

- Forced current-information turns now fail at the search edge explicitly and fall back to local SearXNG before any optional hosted provider.

## 6.4.2 — Clean Paper

- Albert joins Fabric beacon/disco light shows through the local node light state.
- Answer folds now support continuing conversation in place instead of forcing every follow-up into a new card.
- Paste and drag/drop register images/files at Albert’s artifact edge and pass stable file references into the shared LO cognition engine.
- Current-news/headline requests explicitly require live search/tool evidence rather than model-memory answers.

## 6.4.0 — Open Door

- Albert is now reachable from trusted tailnet browsers through Tailscale Serve while remaining loopback-only itself.
- Added `lk albert url`, `lk albert qr`, and `lk albert ipad`/`remote` handoff commands.
- Unified Node advertises Albert local/tailnet URLs.
- Installer prints the iPad/tailnet URL when available.

## 6.3.8 — Browser Seat

- `lk media arts`, `lk media showcase`, and `lk media classic-arts` once again open the official Classic Arts Showcase page in the system default browser.
- Removed the special native HLS/mpv experiment for this Easter egg; All Classical audio remains native.
- Albert keeps its scaled/expandable Classic Arts in-fold presentation.

## 6.3.7 — Window Seat

- Fixed native video presentation when a LOOK-owned mpv already exists as an audio/headless session.
- Audio → video is now treated as a presentation-class transition: LOOK relaunches its owned mpv with explicit `--video=yes --force-window=yes` rather than reusing a hidden audio worker.
- Audio → audio and video → video continue to reuse the existing mpv IPC session.
- Regression coverage includes the `classics` → `arts` sequence that exposed the bug on macOS.

## 6.3.6 — Clean Feed
- Classic Arts Showcase now prefers a direct HLS feed for native playback instead of opening the whole website. Albert uses the direct stream when the browser supports HLS and falls back to a fitted official-page embed.
- Albert video folds now contain the entire frame, add an expand/contract view, and scale website fallbacks into the fold instead of cropping their top-left corner.

## 6.3.5 — Dead Means Dead

- Albert explicitly tears down audio/video/EQ contexts before folds are dismissed or DOM is rebuilt. Saved items remain inert snapshots until reopened on paper.

## 6.3.4 — Saved Means Saved

- Albert Saved entries are durable snapshots that can be reopened onto the live paper after the original fold is dismissed.
- Saved entries now expose `open on paper` and `remove saved` instead of dead live-fold controls.
- Reopened audio folds recreate their player and visualizer normally.

## 6.3.3 — Alive

- Albert now loads the shared native LO engine directly instead of calling Signal's paired-browser `/api/chat` endpoint. Signal can be closed; Albert cognition remains available as long as LOOK/LO is installed.
- Albert keeps its own bounded session history so follow-ups retain context through the shared cognition plane.
- Albert audio folds gain a small live EQ: a real Web Audio analyser for safe local/same-origin audio, with a playback-synchronized fallback for cross-origin streams. Video folds deliberately remain clean.
- `lk player` gains a small audio-only playback visualizer. It never appears for video and is explicitly presentation, not fabricated frequency telemetry.

## 6.3.2 — One Brain

- Albert no longer terminates unknown requests with a fake “understood” cognition receipt.
- Non-fast-path requests now hand off to the shared native LO cognition/tool plane used by Signal.
- Albert persists a browser session id, so follow-ups such as “what was the weather?” retain the active location/context.
- If shared cognition is unavailable, Albert fails closed and says nothing was executed.

# 5.4.7

- Filter beacon/light/RGB/pulse renderer effects out of Dash RECENT.
- Consume terminal ANSI escape sequences before single-key Dash command dispatch so scrolling/arrows cannot trigger beacon.
- Rate-limit the beacon hotkey while a diagnostic show is in flight.
- Harden Signal browser media handoff and stream proxied audio incrementally.

# 5.4.6

- Promote mpv to the normal workstation dependency set so upgrades make Macs playback-ready by default.
- Preserve node-scoped queue/session semantics while exposing browser-safe audio bytes through Fabric.
- Report playback readiness separately from queue/control availability.

# 5.4.5

- Preserve artifact-backed vision routing for browser camera/image resources.

# 5.3.0 — Decision Plane

- Adds renderer-neutral Fabric DecisionRequests with confidence, consequence, reversibility, deadline, preferred choice, and timeout policy.
- Adds non-blocking deadline semantics: Power/Unsafe may continue low-risk reversible work; Workspace/Conservative defer; consequential/irreversible work cancels without explicit confirmation.
- Adds Fabric-wide decision discovery and answering plus Signal one-tap decision cards.
- Adds optional OpenJev-compatible shadow decisions without making the learned worker authoritative or required.
- Adds `lk fabric decisions`, `decision`, `answer`, `ask`, and `decision-shadow`.

# 5.2.19 — Media Session Reliability

- Reuse the LOOK-owned mpv process for ordinary play requests instead of spawning overlapping players.
- Add deterministic first/last/first-on-album media controls for LO.
- Make selector queue mutation canonical-only so Q returns immediately without stream resolution or player I/O.
- Preserve MediaSession as the owner of queue state; mpv remains a playback worker.

# 5.2.18 — LO Media Tools + LOOK Media Filter

- LO can search/play/queue/control Fabric media through purpose-built tools.
- Local media imperatives are host-routed before general inference/search.
- Media find/browse now follow LOOK filter behavior with Tab multi-select and uppercase contextual actions.

## 4.45.1 — Fabric media catalog + selector

- `lk media find`/`browse` now use a native LOOK selector instead of requiring exact title retyping.
- Add `lk media fabric`, `lk media identify`, and catalog-backed media completion.
- Merge online catalog rows by SHA, preserve multi-node locations, and prefer local copies.
- Preserve verified digest metadata across unchanged rescans.

## 4.45.0 — Media sessions + miniplayer

- Add a dependency-free media library/session core.
- Add fast library scanning/search, canonical queues, saved playlists, repeat, and directory/query playback.
- Add `lk player`, a tiny live terminal view over the current LOOK MediaSession.
- Keep mpv as the optional playback edge and preserve Fabric range-stream transport for remote/content-addressed media.

## 4.44.8 — Isolated per-node model qualification

- `lk ollama test --all` now benchmarks enabled models alone under identical 4096-context residency conditions and reports load time separately from warm median TTFT.
- Preserve/restore the pre-test warm set and expose node-local eligible/disabled model candidates in `lk ollama curate`.
- Coordinate with the local Unified Node benchmark guard so automatic qualification/curation and Fabric jobs cannot contaminate residency measurements.

## 4.44.7 — Adaptive model curator

- Stabilize resident-set concurrency testing with warm-up, alternating solo order, three-run medians, and a physical sanity bound.
- Add model-curator controls and purpose evidence display.
- Add canonical 4096-context warm commands for repeatable residency experiments.

## 4.44.6 — Model roles + resident-set evidence

- Model benchmarks now include three deterministic reasoning probes.
- Add `lk ollama test --resident-set` to measure useful overlap among already-resident models without changing residency.
- Fabric model telemetry exposes exact resident identities and raw purpose evidence rather than a single synthetic model score.
- Full Dash leaves a one-column right gutter so PULSE remains visible.

## 4.44.5 — Adaptive Dash geometry

- Responsive Dash now chooses by actual information fit and terminal geometry rather than height alone.
- Wide/short terminals use two-column operational telemetry instead of collapsing to near-Mini.
- Medium layouts use spare rows for additional telemetry and RECENT activity instead of leaving dead space.

## 4.44.4 — Responsive Dash + benchmark evidence

- Persist model benchmark results to `~/.local/share/look/ollama_benchmarks.json`.
- Keep live qualification and full benchmark evidence distinct.
- Surface benchmark fit/tools/agent/exact results through Fabric model observability.
- Make live Dash choose full, condensed, or compact layouts from terminal height.

## 4.44.3 — Model observability

- Dash replaces the ambiguous model asterisk with compact residency and qualification evidence.
- Fabric model inspection shows tested/untested/stale/failed state, TTFT, tok/s, and READY compliance.

## 4.44.2 — Dash polish

- Color-coded RECENT, Mini Dash, simpler controls, no Freeze/Activity toggle.

## 4.44.1 — Ambient Fabric dashboard

- `lk dash` renders meaningful Fabric state transitions as optional, restrained ambient color flashes.
- RECENT now states its observation scope, labels LOCAL/REMOTE events, and makes cross-day timestamps obvious.
- Stream/chunk noise never triggers color flashes.

## 4.43.3

- WEATHER follow-ups remain on the active typed receipt/location instead of relying on prose context.
- Daily high/low questions are answered directly from canonical daily fields.
- Weather accuracy challenges can cross-check the nearest National Weather Service observation.

# Changelog

## 4.43.2
- WEATHER location resolution now happens deterministically before model inference.
- Reuses the most recent explicit weather location from ephemeral interface history and supports operator-owned default location via `LOOK_WEATHER_LOCATION` / `LO_WEATHER_LOCATION`.
- Canonicalizes US state abbreviations for geocoding and distinguishes missing-location questions from provider failures.

## 4.43.1
- WEATHER preflight retries one transient read failure before giving up, while preserving fail-closed receipts and no blind retries for mutations.
- Dashboard Fabric light hotkeys use the daemon control plane, matching the CLI broadcast path.

- `lk fabric lights` exposes synchronized demo, disco, Christmas, pulse, RGB, and stop controls.

## 4.42.0 — Fabric Alive

- `lk fabric beacon` gives the Fabric a synchronized, visible smoke test; `b` triggers it from `lk dash`.
- LO's active inference spinner gains restrained patient status wording on genuinely long waits.
- Weather Fast Edge now uses a compact receipt-only inference payload after deterministic retrieval.
- Dashboard event polling now reads the newest bounded tail instead of eventually freezing on the oldest 128 ledger events.

## 4.9.1 — Fast Edge

- Fixes the 4.9.0 installed-runtime packaging regression by installing and verifying `core/conductor.py` beside `fabric_client.py`.
- Adds an installed-layout smoke import so a coherent source tree can no longer pass release validation while the installed Fabric runtime is incomplete.
- Current weather with an explicit location now takes a deterministic WEATHER preflight edge before inference, eliminating the wasteful "ask model to call obvious tool" round.
- Pure weather turns omit the full tool schema after a successful receipt, reducing prompt cost and allowing a text-only reflex model to phrase the result.
- Fabric telemetry now announces worker/model placement before inference and reports prompt-evaluation time separately from output evaluation.

## 4.9.0 — Reflex Conductor

- Added a zero-I/O deterministic conductor that classifies turns as reflex, balanced, or deep before placement.
- Fabric routing now combines hard capability filtering with residency, live load, measured qualification TTFT/tok-s, locality, model size, and work class.
- LO emits truthful `conductor` events and keeps the chosen worker/model sticky for the rest of the turn.
- Reflex work favors small warm models; deep/code/vision work favors capable larger models without adding an extra LLM round-trip.

## 4.40.0 — Fabric dashboard

- Adds `lk dash` as the operational cockpit over Fabric truth.
- `lk fabric dashboard` / `lk fabric dash` are aliases for the same view.
- Dashboard links to Fabric watch, settings, doctor, and confirmed managed-service restart.

## 4.39.3 — Fabric HTTP diagnostics

- `lk fabric http` now passes through to the Unified Node HTTP pressure view.
- Ships with Future Crash + LOOK 4.7.3 ingress-process isolation.

## 4.39.2 — Provenance receipts + lean Fabric routing

- Emit deterministic source receipts from the information edge that actually ran instead of relying on model prose to preserve provenance.
- Native LO event streams carry `source_receipt` metadata for browser interfaces such as Signal.
- Fabric placement reuses one atomic node snapshot per attempt and removes duplicate control-plane polling.

## 4.39.1 — Trust basis

- Refresh authoritative system-clock context on every LO turn.
- Enforce live WEATHER receipts for current/forecast weather before an answer may cross the final-response boundary.

## 4.38.5

- Fabric LO now tolerates transient control-plane route discovery timeouts instead of exposing raw urllib timeout errors.

## 4.37.1 — Machine-local model scope

- Local model selection is pinned to localhost and is no longer affected by the legacy Ollama host override.
- Remote direct-host model preferences are stored per endpoint and cannot overwrite the local fallback model.
- `ollama_model` is no longer portable profile state; old profile restores skip it.
- `lk models`/Local AI stay local, while `lk ollama models` deliberately follows the legacy direct host.

## 4.33.10

- Enforces the documented 180-second timeout on primary streamed Ollama chat requests.
- Emits `inference_cancelled` plus terminal `request_done` status in JSONL mode.
- One-shot machine cancellation exits with status 130 instead of reopening an input prompt.

## 4.33.9

- Shared inference discovery + JSONL observability.
- Fixed document continuation re-anchor state crash.

## 4.33.4 — Resource attention lifecycle

- ResourceRef handles persist while expensive image payloads become attention-sensitive.
- New images attach once; ordinary conversational follow-ups stay text-only.
- Visual follow-ups recheck the relevant image, and comparison language can revive recent images from the session resource archive.
- Successful vision observation strips image payloads before later tool rounds, avoiding repeated multimodal retries and context cost.

## 4.33.3 — Vision transport hardening

- Preserves Ollama HTTP error bodies instead of hiding the useful server diagnostic.
- Retries image turns without tools, then without thinking controls, only when Ollama returns HTTP 400.
- Keeps ResourceRef and context-governor behavior unchanged.

## 4.33.2 — Vision resources + context governor

- Image ResourceRefs now attach to vision-capable Ollama models, including Finder/desktop drops and LOOK selections.
- Resource context stays cheap: multi-file/large-document sets no longer eager-preview into the prompt.
- `read_file` supports bounded offset slices for progressive evidence gathering.
- Per-turn context governor tells LO its context/output ceiling and directs multi-document work through compact evidence cycles.
- Non-vision models report image resources without pretending to inspect them.

## 4.33.1 — Resource binding fix

- Active ResourceRef manifest is now refreshed in one stable model-facing slot.
- Explicit resource IDs are adjacent to the user intent on every turn.
- Small text resources receive bounded content previews; directories stay lazy.

## 4.33.0 — Resource Context

- Fixes tooling-audit profile resolver.

## 4.30.0 — Generic agent/tool boundary

- `_tool_transaction()` owns timing, execution, classification and forensic journaling.
- Repairs malformed legacy receipt separators automatically.
- `_TOOL_POLICY` makes capability access declarative.
- New tools can plug into the common harness instead of bespoke receipt plumbing.

- Resource type becomes deterministic edge metadata before model ranking.
- YouTube play/watch selects videos, not merely relevant pages.
- Action receipts express the strongest observed state and no stronger.
- Local media uses DISPATCH OK; playback remains unobserved.

## 4.21.0 — One resource/action harness

- Local path and public URL actions share the same intent → discovery → candidate → action → receipt discipline.
- Explicit web scope never falls back to local discovery; local scope never silently escalates to web.
- `open_url` opens exact search-returned URLs and produces a forensic receipt.
- Repeat/referent state can carry URLs as well as paths.

## 4.20.3 — Do not promote receipts into stronger facts

- Dispatch receipts no longer authorize unobserved runtime/playback claims.
- Human-readable rolling receipt viewer exposed through `lk receipts`.

- Adds formatter regression check to architecture audit.

## 4.19.1 — Runtime hotfix

- AI pool uses the existing atomic JSON infrastructure.

- Shorter shell budgets and visible Ctrl-C cancellation.
- Direct `lk locator-test` diagnostic.

## 4.17.0 — Observable locator and AI pool

- Flush locator stage events while a tool is running.
- Durable host/model role map: primary, fast, background, fallback.
- No change to proven primary-model execution semantics yet.

## 4.16.0 — Adaptive locator

- Nearby discovery stays local; broad discovery uses the OS index.
- Global home recursion removed from interactive search.
- Locator reports elapsed milliseconds.

## 4.15.0 — Interactive agent contract

- Bounded one-directory listing.
- Search is discovery; listing is inspection.
- Semantic candidate evaluation and clarification are part of the agent loop.
- Ordinary personal-file reads do not prompt for workspace grants.
- Tool completion is not treated as task completion.

## 4.14.0 — Authority profiles

- Workspace is context, not permission boundary.
- Broad user-file perception is normal.
- Workspace allows journaled personal-file actions without shell.

## 4.1.0 — Living AI broker + Living Memory

- Resident `look_ai.py` broker coordinates background LO jobs, memory, and skill reflection.
- Unix socket provides fast status/wake control; disk queues preserve crash recovery.
- Foreground leases prevent new maintenance work from starting during interactive LO turns.
- Memory uses elapsed-time decay, semantic reinforcement, event-driven consolidation, and candidate retirement after promotion.

## 4.0.3 — Learn from successful use

- Added deterministic `inspect_directory` counts/statistics.
- Added weak-supervision feedback detection and a detached skill-reflection worker.
- Added reinforced learned-skill metadata without sacrificing editable `skills.md`.

- Non-TTY output remains deterministic and animation-free.

## 3.13.3 — Responsive global find

- `f`/`fznv` no longer precompute a 20k-entry catalog before accepting input.
- Search is streaming again, so fzf accepts keystrokes immediately while paths continue arriving.
- Finder colors/pointer/spinner are aligned with LOOK, while LOOK still owns post-selection actions.

## 3.13.2 — File-action status codes

- `_copy`, `_move`, `_remove`, `_mkdir`, and `_touch` now return status matching their textual result.
- Missing-directory prompts/refusals are failures until the requested mutation actually completes.

## 3.13.1 — Batch transaction hardening

## 3.12.1 — Preserve j/k in filter text

- Filter input no longer consumes lowercase `j` or `k` as movement.
- `J/K` and arrow keys navigate matches while filter text is active.
- Browse/select mode keeps normal `j/k` navigation.

## 3.12.0 — Cross-directory working set

- Marked paths are owned by the filer session rather than a single directory view.
- Navigation never clears the working set.
- Status distinguishes local selection from cross-directory selection with color and `N / H HERE`.
- `X` clears the set.
- `<` is now filesystem parent; the temporary `>` binding is retired.

## 3.11.0 — Parent directory key

- In the plain filer browse state, `>` moves to the real filesystem parent.
- Parent navigation and history navigation are now separate concepts.
- Filter-entry mode still accepts `>` as normal text.

## 3.10.5 — Simpler filer keys

- `j/J` moves down; `k/K` moves up; arrows work as expected.
- `L` is reserved for handing the selected/marked working set to LO.
- Removed the unnecessary semicolon and pseudo-horizontal/home-row navigation bindings.

## 3.10.4 — Selected paths become LO context

- In filer FILTER/SELECT mode, `L` launches LO with the marked paths as its working context.
- One unmarked highlighted path works the same way.
- Paths are passed as a manifest, not bulk file contents.
- LO's bounded workspace is rooted at the nearest common selected directory and its banner reports the context count.

## 3.10.3 — Execution contract

- Explicit local filesystem mutation requests must now produce an actual mutation tool call before LO may report success.
- Prose-only mutation plans receive one silent tool-required repair pass.
- Added bounded read-only host process, listening-port, and system snapshot tools for routine diagnostics in Workspace.
- Added one extra tool-loop round for multi-step host work.

## 3.10.2 — lmv/lcp argument hardening

- Multi-source `lmv` and `lcp` now copy argv to an array, pop the final destination, and pass only true sources to the batch engine.
- This removes an ambiguous Zsh parameter-slice expression that could accidentally include the destination as a source.

## 3.10.1 — Continuity and reliable batches

- Added literal cross-session recent conversation, distinct from semantic candidate and long-term memory.
- Fixed long-term consolidation so useful candidates can graduate while strong rather than merely decay forever.
- Added batch text-file creation for multi-file LO requests with unified undo.
- Added multi-source `lcp`, `lmv`, and `lrm` command-line forms.

- Geographic name resolution uses Open-Meteo geocoding.
- Wikipedia search provides compact canonical article matches for stable background knowledge.
- Generic web search remains available for everything that does not fit a canonical edge.
- Each retrieval announces itself in the terminal so information flow stays visible.

## 3.5.1 — durable memory lifecycle

- Explicit durable-memory intent promotes into the long-term summary immediately.
- Adds duplicate candidate consolidation.
- Adds periodic long-term summary pruning under a fixed budget.


## 3.5.0 — unified version safety + Zsh command grammar

- Establishes LOOK 3.5.0 as the component baseline inside Future Crash + LOOK 1.2.0.
- Adds context-sensitive Zsh completion for `lk` and `lo`.
- Completes Ollama, memory, skills, system commands, and saved remote host names.
- Unified installer records component versions and refuses accidental downgrade from version-aware releases.

## 3.3.3 — thinking-output compatibility

- Prefer Ollama's structured `message.thinking` field when available.
- Continue supporting normal `<think>...</think>` model-template output.
- Add Qwen compatibility for responses where the opening `<think>` is stripped but the closing `</think>` remains.
- Render reasoning under muted/italic `thinking ›` and the final response under normal `lo ›`.
- No streaming, capability, tool, filesystem, remote-host, settings, or installer behavior changed.


## 3.3.2 — installer man-page path fix

- Fixes the 3.3.1 installer error `SCRIPT_DIR: unbound variable`.
- The optional user man-page install now uses the installer's existing `ROOT` source directory.
- No runtime, settings, LO, filesystem, or documentation behavior changed.


## 3.3.1 — documentation synchronization

- Synchronizes README, `lk help`, migration notes, installer metadata, repository command reference, and Unix man page with LOOK 3.3.
- Restores `lk.1` to the release and documents `lk settings`, all LO access profiles, and the full Ollama host/share/key/access grammar.
- Adds `docs/COMMANDS.md` as a compact repository reference; this is documentation only, not a `tldr` integration.


## 3.3.0 — unified settings + LO presentation

- Adds `lk settings`, a single interactive panel over existing access-profile, Ollama-host, preferred-model, web-key, and Tailscale-share controls.
- The settings panel creates no second configuration system; direct commands and existing state remain canonical.
- Thinking-capable model output now renders `<think>...</think>` as a muted/italic `thinking ›` section, visually separate from the final `lo ›` response.
- Existing `file ›`, `command ›`, and `search ›` activity remains distinct.
- No capability semantics, confirmation rules, filesystem behavior, remote routing, or installer ownership model changed.


## 3.2.0 — LO capability profiles

- Adds `conservative`, `workspace`, `power`, and `unsafe` LO access profiles; existing workspace behavior remains the default.
- Adds `run_command` only in power/unsafe sessions. Commands execute on the computer running LOOK even when inference comes from a remote Ollama host.
- Power confirms every shell command; unsafe asks once on session entry and then skips per-command prompts.
- `lk ollama access [MODE]` inspects/sets the persistent profile; `lo --MODE` overrides it for one session.
- Access flags compose with `@HOST` in either order.
- `lk ollama` now reports the selected access profile.
- No existing filesystem, clipboard, filter, undo, remote-host, or installer grammar was removed.


## 3.1.8 — consistent directory resolution

- `ll`, `ld`, `lf`, `lt`, `lr`, and `lz` now resolve directory arguments the same way as `l`: exact directory first, otherwise zoxide shorthand.
- Specialized views keep their existing mode and do not change the parent shell directory.
- No filter, selection, clipboard, Ollama, installer, undo, or file-operation behavior changed.


## 3.1.7 — public shell hygiene

- Removed four personal/project-specific aliases that had accidentally shipped in the public shell fragment.
- Audited shipped shell/config/code files for personal usernames, absolute home paths, and private project launchers.
- No LOOK-owned aliases, functions, interaction grammar, Ollama behavior, installer behavior, or file operations changed.


## 3.1.6 — polite shell integration

- Installer no longer replaces `~/.zshrc` wholesale.
- Existing `.zshrc` is still timestamp-backed up before any edit.
- LOOK shell configuration now lives in `~/.config/look/look.zsh`.
- Installer adds/normalizes one marked source block in the user's existing `.zshrc`.
- Reinstall/update refreshes only LOOK's owned fragment.
- `lk uninstall` removes the marked hook and fragment; legacy installs retain backup restoration behavior.
- No LOOK interaction, Ollama, clipboard, filter, navigation, or file-operation behavior changed.


## 3.1.5 — filter footer label

- Restore `E edit` to the interactive filter/select footer. Edit behavior was already intact; only its visible command hint had been lost.
- No runtime behavior changed.


## 3.1.4 — documentation reconciliation

- Audited the executable command dispatch, Zsh shortcuts, Ollama host/share/key grammar, and interactive file controls against the documentation.
- `lk help` is now the complete in-terminal command/key glossary, including Ollama `share status/off`, `key/status`, host selection/forget, uninstall, undo, webterm, and the full selection action language.
- README Reference now carries the same canonical command map, organized by intent.
- No runtime behavior changed.


## 3.1.3

- Make Ollama model choice host-aware: keep the preferred model when installed on the selected host, otherwise use a resident or installed model instead of surfacing Ollama's model-not-found 404.
- Restore `O open with` to the wrapped interactive filter/select footer; the action itself was never removed.


## 3.1.2 — Tailscale permission handoff

- `lk ollama share` keeps the localhost Host-rewrite proxy alive when Tailscale Serve requires root/operator permission.
- On that permission failure, LOOK prints the exact one-time `sudo tailscale serve --bg 11435` handoff instead of tearing the proxy back down.
- `lk ollama share off` gives the matching sudo handoff when needed.
- LOOK never invokes `sudo` itself and does not alter Tailscale operator configuration.


## 3.1.1 — Ollama share fix

- `lk ollama share` now places a tiny localhost-only proxy between Tailscale Serve and Ollama.
- The proxy rewrites the public tailnet `Host` header to `localhost:11434`, preserving Ollama's host protection while allowing private Tailscale Serve access.
- No new dependency, installer layer, command grammar, or unrelated behavior changes.


## 3.1.0 — Ollama anywhere

- Adds named Ollama host profiles while keeping `local` as the permanent built-in default.
- `lk ollama host` lists saved hosts and discovers reachable Ollama servers on Tailscale peers using their device hostnames.
- `lk ollama host NAME` selects a persistent default; `lk ollama host NAME URL` saves/selects an explicit endpoint.
- `lo @NAME` uses a host for one session without changing the default.
- `lk ollama share` shares localhost Ollama inside the tailnet through Tailscale Serve; `share status` and `share off` are included.
- Ollama inspection, model control, benchmarks, web search, memory, and workspace tools follow the selected host.
- Tailscale remains optional; local LOOK behavior is unchanged when it is absent.


## 3.0.5 — escape polish

- Hidden Ollama key entry: Esc, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, or empty Enter cancels cleanly.
- LO: Ctrl-C during thinking/searching cancels the current turn and returns control instead of tearing down the session.
- Filter typing captures queued keystrokes before redraw with a 12 ms idle gap instead of 55 ms.
- No command grammar, selection semantics, clipboard behavior, undo, or installer scope changed.


## 3.0.4 — Ollama key setup

- Adds `lk ollama key` and `lk ollama key status`.
- Excludes `key` from the historical long-form Ollama chat route, so these commands are handled locally rather than sent to `lo`.
- README encourages optional free Ollama account/API-key setup for web search.
- No other LOOK behavior changed.


## 3.0.3 — GitHub install instructions

- Removes the brittle guessed `/releases/latest/download/look-shell.zip` recipe.
- Documents two dependable install paths: GitHub Releases and Code → Download ZIP.
- Explains why `chmod +x install.sh` is needed after GitHub ZIP downloads.
- Makes clear that the installer is folder-name agnostic; `look-shell-main` and versioned release folders both work.
- No LOOK interaction, clipboard, selection, undo, uninstall, installer dependency, or LO behavior changed.


## 3.0.2 — clean exit

- Adds `lk uninstall`.
- Installer records exact package/add-on ownership for safe removal later.
- Uninstall restores the recorded pre-LOOK `.zshrc`, while preserving the current LOOK-era `.zshrc` as a timestamped recovery copy.
- `~/.zsh_secrets` is never removed.
- Homebrew/Linuxbrew itself is never automatically removed.
- README adds a copy/paste GitHub `releases/latest/download/look-shell.zip` installation path.
- No browser, clipboard, mark, navigation, undo, or LO grammar changed.


## 3.0.1 — complete mark toggle

- `A` now toggles the entire current match set: mark all when any are unmarked; clear all when all are already marked.
- This works with live filters, so `A` can select or deselect exactly the visible match set.
- No other selection, clipboard, navigation, undo, installer, or LO behavior changed.


## 3.0.0-beta.16 — onboarding and installer

No filesystem/browser grammar changed.

- The installer now explicitly treats LOOK as an opinionated workstation: `fd`, Chafa, Poppler, `ttyd`, and `lsof` join the existing core toolset.
- Tailscale is offered as the Remote layer (default Yes); Ollama is offered as the AI layer (default No).
- `--yes` accepts optional layers; `--no-optional` installs only the workstation.
- `webterm()` now explains missing requirements instead of falling through to shell errors.
- The first LOOK-initiated Neovim edit teaches `Esc`, `:q`, `Enter` once.
- README is rewritten around LOOK's present-day mental model rather than release archaeology.
- Documentation stays deliberately small: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the built-in `lk help`.
